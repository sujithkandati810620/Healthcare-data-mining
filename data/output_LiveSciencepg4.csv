Unlike the UK lockdown, there are no official guidelines on stepping out for a walk while maintaining SD guidelines. So what should I do? How do I encourage authorities online to allow safe and responsible daily exercise routines?  What data and studies (if any) are available at the moment to support my claims? Please exercise indoors as India is not UK and spread of virus in india is largely unmonitored and therefore risks of going out is not advisable It is just my opinion that staying indoors can be a problem, because it will allow for many other micro-organisms to flourish in your body. It is important during normal times NOT to stay in a small space because it will enable bacteria and other organisms like fungus to grow in your body and near your body, while regular activity like going to work, going to the store, going outside for recreation, will cause your environment to change often, which will prevent the prolific growth of micro-organisms. I am not a professional, but this is normally not wisdom to stay in your home all of every day, and can cause illness without new exposure. Staying indoors in a multi-residential building can be a problem as a virus can move from one infected room to another especially with forced air circulation. But going outdoors for a short time cannot help much other than some exercise is good for general health and improving immunity. It may be helpful in warding off other health problems but probably will not help much with coronavirus.  If you are healthier, the effect of coronavirus may be milder. Just a thought."

I know that having a ""water bottle"" attached to a mask would be uncomfortable, but that's not important, would it work? I just wonder about the actual design on something on this.

How long would COVID-19 particles stay in the air of an elevator to infect someone? Up to 3 hours, according to researchers. This is a big part of the reason that it's so critical not to go out into public places unless absolutely needed. Wash your hands. Don't go out in public areas unless you must. Thank you for sharing that article. Oh boy, this is really bad news for me. I am in a situation where I am obligated to leave my house everyday and my apartment is on the 14th floor. On top of that, my cardiovascular health isn't the greatest. If I try and climb 14 flights of stairs, COVID-19 will be the least of my problems. Heart attack will get me first. What to do, what to do... I guess I'll take the stairs and hope I don't have a heart attack. You're probably fine to continue taking the elevator, in that case. But practice as much safety as you can - bump the elevator buttons with your elbow instead of your fingers, be sure to wash your hands before leaving your home, and before starting anything after you arrive at your destination. It's impossible to be 100% safe, but you can absolutely take proactive steps to limit your exposure and reduce potential infection, or spreading infection to others.  Handwashing and social distancing (remaining 6 or more feet away from others while out) is critical. I think you need to put on scuba gear to be safe. The virus can still deposit on the scuba gear and your clothes and eventually to your hands and then when you touch your eyes or nose, you can get infected. If there is a suction fan in the elevator, It might pull out the virus from the cab. You need to keep a piece of paper towel to insulate your finger when pushing the elevator button and carefully discard it when you get off. The virus can be airborne because small drops do not fall quickly to the ground and some people believe there are virus traces in human exhaled air. The poorer countries have 100 times lower infection rates that I think is due to fewer high rise buildings and open ventilation."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/can-you-use-air-con-during-pandemic.2587/,Can you use Air Con during Pandemic,"Hi everyone Our weather has got really hot and it's almost impossible to work from home.  I have a portable air conditioner but I don't know if it's safe to use during the coronavirus pandemic.  I've emailed the govt for guidelines, but don't know if I'll get an answer, so thought I'd ask here. The air con would obviously cause air flow in my property, so of course I'm concerned for me.  Then it would vent out of a window that overlooks a fairly busy street.  The people passing below my window are at least 3 metres down.  No one is ever aware of it when they walk past, so it doesn't disturb anyone on the street, you can't feel it, or the heat, etc......it disperses long before it gets even halfway down.  But that's the temperature and feel of it.  I don't know about viruses.  I have no symptoms, but that's no guarantee. I will only use it if I get plenty of evidence that it's safe for both others and for myself.   I was happy to just not use it and wait, but it's only set to get hotter and the sole reason I purchased it is because it's impossible to remain in my apartment or get any work done in the heat.  But I will put up with that unless it's safe. Thanks. My gut feel is that it should not affect people 3 meters away. But if you want to be very conservative you can have yourself tested. If you wait about 5 days you will probably develop symptoms if you are infected. If nobody in your house has an infection, and you don't go out shopping to a confined shopping place, you will likely not get infected. No air flow between inside and outside is necessary.  Install in window and fire that puppy up.  Read the AC unit manual. Assuming your air con is not evaporation. I'm in the UK,  we are past the peak and I was ill about 8 or 9 weeks ago.  Due to very late testing availability I've no idea if it was Covid. I can look into testing now, but even if it's deemed safe, I suppose I'd want to know if it's safe in general terms, because of how people are going to feel walking under it otherwise.  Although you can't really hear it, you can see it from the street as the vent is coming out of the window. Thanks I will have a better look at it tomorrow, I'm in the UK.  I've no idea how it works, lol, I just switch on and place the vent tube out of the window. Not sure about evaporation, but each year I just switch it on.  I suppose I'm asking for a lung infection, but this was all pre covid, lol, I'll be more careful now."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/why-are-we-all-sitting-at-home.2193/,Why are we all sitting at home?,"Does the current method for combatting Covid 19 make any sense at all? Why are we keeping almost every American at home with businesses shut when the vast majority of cases only prove deadly or serious enough to be admitted to a hospital to a relatively small percentage of the population?  And that percentage is almost entirely made up of people who have other complications making them immunocompromised or are over 65 and retired anyways.   In fact, not even all people over 65 are vulnerable to hospitalization.  It's being over 65 being immunocompromised when the higher risks start becoming apparent. Why don't we just isolate this vulnerable population and let the rest of us get it and then be on with our lives.  We can afford to keep a small percentage of the population isolated until either the rest of the people achieve herd immunity or a vaccine is developed.  That sounds a lot better than bivouacking Hasn't anybody even mentioned this seemingly obvious alternative?  And--if they have and there's a good answer why it's unfeasible--why haven't we ever heard about it? This is driving me nuts.  Could somebody chime in? Welcome to the club.  When man doesn't have true understanding and knowledge, man uses statistics.  It's our science now. We develop a strategy from those numbers at that time.  This strategy requires cooperation and time. If we give that cooperation and give that time, we will see if the strategy works. Our leaders were told it could be the greatest death event in our history. It's not whether are leaders were correct, it's whether our academics and science are correct. Only time will tell us.  And if that strategy was worth the time and sacrifice. Does one person's health, reason enough to restrict another person's lifestyle? So far, the virus hasn't killed as much as recreational drugs/alcohol do. We give safe areas for drug use in our cities. In principle, a good idea. Isolate the old. A few things to consider. Who will take care of these old people? The nursing home industry with its predatory pricing will send even a millionaire to a poorhouse in no time. The old will meet certain death.  One infected caretaker will kill several of these old people. Even if you test the caretaker, she may get infected soon from going home or grocery shopping or whatever.  Many of the caretakers come from the underprivileged strata of society and cannot be expected to remain uninfected.  Even people from the upper strata cannot be relied upon because the infection routes are not well understood. Remember, we have these same problems right now with the same group of people.  What difference does it make to hospitals (or morticians, for that matter) if someone outside of this group gets it or not?  The relatively young and otherwise healthy won't be knocking on their doors, anyway. Thanks for the welcome! I'm not even sure I understand the strategy.  One thing is for sure, we aren't going to be able to afford to have everyone at home for the next year and a half until a vaccine might be developed.  That's just a non debatable fact. The genie is out of the bottle, there's no putting it back so what is our only remaining option?  You protect the vulnerable as best you can, release people and let herd immunity perform it's natural duty.  There's no other way that I see doing it. So what would have been gained by our month in quarantine by releasing people today?  Nothing.  A hardcore, everybody-is-grounded quarantine might be right (might) in a place like NYC where the total numbers have swamped the system, but in most places it simply hasn't. Our Covid numbers have been flat now for the past month at about 30K new cases per day.  We have almost 1 million infected, and if you believe the 13 X reported cases to actually have been infected (as per the recent antibody-presence study performed in NY), that means we have only infected and then presumably made at least temporary immune one in every 25 Americans.  At that rate it means another year and a half before we reach 70% herd immunity.   Good luck if the US government is going to keep us going that long. With the exception of New York metro area and Boston, I don't personally know of any hospital systems in the country being stretched.  With our only reasonable option being getting as many people immune while maintaining an operational hospital system, we are way behind. Here in New Hampshire we average about 85 cases a day.    Fourteen percent of those are admitted to the hospitals.  That's about 12 new patients per day.  With the average stay in hospital of 10 days, that means that as thing are frozen, we are handling 120 covid cases at any given time.  I estimate we have about 2500+ beds available (including normal surplus bed capacity plus state emergency temporary sites).    We've had 1864 confirmed cases and even if the antibody tests are accurate we've only then had 24,300 cases reported and unreported.  This past month of quarantine has bought us less than 2 percent of our population immune.   Do the math for your own state and you might be surprised at how underutilized it is when it is essential for us to get back to work. It seems that where the infections have run riot is in very large, densely packed, international cities that didn't see it coming and so imposed no restrictions or warnings while things were taking hold.  For all we know, it is only under these circumstances that you might get a run away event.  After all, even Los Angeles hasn't been swamped despite its size and connection to the world with the only element missing from the equation being ""densely packed.""  Chicago, that has all the elements but only about 40% of the case load as NYC had warning before the virus had a chance to accelerate. And we're keeping everybody in the nation locked down?  Lock downs aren't just boring annoyances.  Anything that goes on much longer will come with massive bankruptcies--personal and otherwise--at a rate that surpass anything that's come before, including the Great Depression.  Ever hear that adage ""most Americans live paycheck by paycheck?""  I can't even imagine what would happen if we tried to sustain our current strategy. Protecting the vulnerable while releasing the rest of the country is the only solution I see.  The rest is playing games that wastes precious time while distracting us from reality. It is a humanitarian issue, not just the economy.  The young can sacrifice the old but the young will get old someday too. There is no doubt about it. By the way, I am one of those old so have a slightly different perspective. The economic losses are manageable for the USA by just printing money. Everything that is needed can be imported with fiat money because of the hegemony of the dollar.  If you think about it, all this stuff we import from China and the third world is virtually free with fiat money. We don't really need any industries and most businesses. We need food and water and electricity for sure but they are not jeopardized. The rest of the problem is how do we distribute the funny money we print. Who gets how much? Other countries are not so fortunate. They cannot print their way out. Well, if you go out and you have the virus but are okay and you breathe over someone who doesn't and they breathe over someone who goes home to a care worker, then you can have infected at least one vulnerable person when that care worker goes back to work.  Add up the number of people you run in a day and then add in the number of people they meet and then figure if there is a safer way than you not going out. Just  saying... I do understand the purpose of social distancing.  The problem is it comes at an astounding cost.  And there is real evidence that an out-of-control outbreak might never happen even under limited controls. We know that in Sweden they have only a few limitations.  People still go to work and kids go to school (except for universities).  Everyone always compares their total cases to their two neighbors, Norway and Finland; but these countries are at a near dead end in terms of passage.  What isn't mentioned is that--despite the narrative--Sweden's cases are lower than most of the rest of the western European countries. Iceland is, of course, more remote, and their cases are large by comparison, but this is due to them in the middle of a nationwide testing effort--therefore, finding more cases.  Their death rates (a better proximity of the state of the outbreak than cases), are amongst the lowest in western Europe. I know that these are only two cases to compare, but they're the only ones we have available to measure.  And remember that we are currently holding up this economy on mere speculation.  We still have no concrete evidence of how deadly coronavirus is.  And yet with little evidence we have still deemed it necessary to shut down the economy.  Which assumption do you work with?  One with little to no evidence to support it or one with some evidence? And once again, yes all these people can pass the virus on to the next person, I get that.  But we can always better protect the vulnerable.  After all, bubble boys manage it. Social distancing was never meant to rid this virus out of existence.  Social distancing won't do that - unless you keep everybody (as in all 7.7 billion of us here on planet Earth) isolated from each other for what, 14 days?  20 days? a month? The purpose of social distancing and isolating yourself was to keep the virus from spreading rapidly and overwhelming our healthcare system.  Now outside of New York state, New Jersey, California (although California is a big state), Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Michigan (and there's a lot of states that don't appear to be reporting active hospitalizations so I don't know where they fall).  But if a state's healthcare system isn't being overrun, then maybe it's time to think about cautiously opening those states up. Opening up is the only way we're going to get new data.  The only thing we're doing by pushing tests every where is adding to the confirmed case tally.  They are literally begging people - people who have no symptoms - to get tested in the area where I live.  If you test positive but you're not a burden on the healthcare system... then does it really count?  Now, the point about knowing who's got it so they don't spread it to someone else, that's valid.  BUT if the healthcare system is not being overrun, then how much are they really spreading it? You have got to start getting new data so you can feed that into your models.  It's the only way you're going to get a more precise view of how this thing works.  Maybe you opening things up and it all goes to hell, at least then you'll know. I guess you can color me a skeptic in all of this.  I don't really mean to be.  I tend to split this whole thing up into two parts.  There is a legitimate health concern with this virus, I don't mean to downplay that.  But the other part of it is the fear.  I know people, I have relatives that are so scared to death of this virus, they won't go outside, they won't go to the mailbox, they won't do anything that might have a hint of making them get this virus.  And the media and the politics just pile that on.  Look at the numbers in the midwest and the central plains.  Why are there no news outlets reporting from there?  They're all in New York. Fear. It is an short and sweet as that. And all these fears have their place and their validity. Still,  I think these are probably on the money in showing fear is going to do a lot, if not more damage than covid-19... plus TP running a race is kind of funny. Hello! I think this is simple. We are sitting at home, because this is a new and deadly virus. I think we should be chilling a bit and wait at home.  If you have some extra time, read some jokes, and have some fun Being in an enclosed space make you more vulnerable to get the virus if there is any viral particles  in the air. The viral load sits there and can infect you if you come near it. When you're outside, especially in the sun, you are safer. The viral load spreads and doesn't hover like it does inside. The heat of the sun is protective against the virus and gives you vitamin D, which enhances the immune system.  If you are isolating, I'd advise you take walks outside. Wear a mask and stay away from people if that makes you more comfortable. But give your body that natural protection that it needs. It’s better to stay at home if it’s not Necessary to go out to be safe from the Deadly Corona virus...it’s better not be infected. Scientists have posited that inflation, a fleeting period of exponential growth just after the big bang, was central to the universe's structure today. Now they have a hint that they are right. Considering the implications of a continued lockdown and an understanding amongst the populace that visiting their grandmother could kill her, I don't think people would act as thoughtlessly as to defy any mandates by any significant measure. Take a look at the comment I posted somewhere below this one titled, ""The case for herd immunity.""  That might show you the issue in a different light. Staying at home began with the intentions of flattening the curve, which we have. The CDC website offers information on ICU beds available as well as ventilators available in each state. There are a lot of both, in the case that we need them. Reopening slowly will keep it this way. Unfortunately, if we continue to stay at home, we will not have the data we need to fight this. We don’t even have an accurate death rate because we don’t know how many people have contracted the disease and survived- those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and did not see a doctor. This is a testing issue, of course, but it’s relevant to the conversation because it’s probable that at one point or another, we will all contract the disease. When we do, we want our scientists and doctors to be equipped with all the information they need to help. Yes, people die from COVID-19, and it’s truly awful. Any life lost is one too many. We have stayed home together to flatten the curve, but I think it’s time to emerge together to provide our scientists with the data they need to combat this virus. I think that those who have underlying health conditions and wish to protect themselves should stay home or should be cautious, wear masks, and avoid large crowds. But if you are young and healthy, you should be able to make those choices for yourself. And if you do show symptoms? Stay home. It’s not ideal and it won’t protect everyone, but this disease is not going away. We have to learn to live with it, or else we will always hide in our homes. And that simply won’t work. Can you give me the link to that CDC website? The comment I just addressed seems to have disappeared.  Makes it looks like I'm talking to myself.  (For which I'm fully expecting to receive my very first thumbs-up.) Thanks very much!  I'll take a look."

That means that if other people in your household with the lid open, germs from previous users will spread anyway, even if those previous shut the lid on their turn. Years ago it was discovered that farts could transmit diseases.  How long do you think it will be before they connect the dots and state that farts can transmit this disease since it lives in fecal matter? what are you doing running around naked farting at people anyway The Chinese are saying the virus is found in urine and feceas, ulcers to the lungs like Sars and Mers. You can do those things when you are old.     Shoo'ng kids off the lawn, spanking puppies and running around naked, farting at people.     One of the perq's of old age. Major parts of Asia, NYC and San Fran allow people to defecate on streets. The feces will then dry out and can become airborne. Could this make NYC and San Fran hot spots? I guess majority of people don't know the fact that . After pooping, they use only a little water and bare hands instead of toilet paper. Just imagine what they have beneath their nails. Now imagine what happens when they work in food industry, food gets infected within seconds. Not really news. Almost all disease viral or bacteriological can to some degree spread through fresh warm poop and even fresh cooling poop only hours old. Big news would be that it lasted days or weeks or could pass through rough primary sewage treatment plants to rivers (as might happen during heavy rainfall even in most US cities or in lesser developed countries where primary treatment was the high bar). Paper fails quite a bit as does where you hold it. Its distressing that you imply you see no need to use  soap and water after pooping simply because you use toilet paper. Wink. Seriously water as water cleaning of posterior is SUPERIOR to toilet paper. Paper leaves smears. Bidets are more ecologically sound as well. Cheaper on plumbing clogs for household too. *** In all cases (toilet paper or bidet) you should use soap and water on hands with inspection and cleaning of fingernails. *** Bidets are fairly standard through out the world barring North America and the UK. Even the UK is slowly transitioning to bidet availability and soap and water for hands afterward. Of course every national rivalry, mostly friendly or not, will probably make reference to ""...except rival B where they do not wipe or wash at all..."" to the other side. It's you who implies that all Chinese use soap after touching their poop with bare hand, can you guarantee that they use soap afterwards?  NO! You've said: -IT DOES if you are ignorant enough not to FOLD IT ONCE OR TWICE before use. . Anyway, if it happens that I touch a bit of feces, then I wash my hands at least two times more than usual, because it leaves terrible stench. On the other hand, you are grabbing fistful of your warm poop with your bare hands each time after defecation, like some  filthy disgusting  monkey.  You must be stinking, and probably got used to the stench, same as many Chinese people stink, and I'm not trying to insult them that by saying that, it's just a fact. Imagine a worker in food industry, who doesn't use toilet paper, touching your food few minutes after touching feces. Very hygienic, yeah right. Enough of this crappy topic! Thank you.  I think some of this may have originated with an epidemiological study tracing the spread of Covid 19 in waste water treatment plants.  I don't think anything in that study implied any cause.  But wash your hands, and fold your paper, and enough! roki Ni.....is that true?  In the mid seventies, I had some contract work, on some large migrant farms in southern Florida.  I asked the farm foreman where the restroom was, and he yelled out in a foreign language and shortly he was brought a roll of toilet paper.  He handed it to me and showed me the latrine.  There was no toilet paper in the place, but beside every toilet there was a small can of brown water. Later that night, the foreman explained the purpose of those cans.  I could not believe it.  Young and dumb.  I have always washed store bought vegetables since."

Some of those sacrifices will lead to physical death; some to the loss of physical or mental well-being; some to the death of common, everyday dreams for both the sacrificer and their future children. Who is more important and why? See for a start to a list of what the masses have up for sacrifice; the list includes many things that are considered socially stabilizing or contributing to quality of life. “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars” – Oscar Wilde. For me, doing things to mitigate COVID-19 deaths should not mean shoving the majority face-down in the gutter. All lives are important.  There are certainly some who feel that sacrificing a percentage of the population is beneficial to the rest, but the virus does not make any sort of value choice, it takes anyone that comes within its reach. I don't know of anyone who would voluntarily put their loved ones or close friends at risk of the suffering and death this pandemic promises. This is an important topic, and I'd like to see more discussion, provided we all stay within the Forum Rules: (in other words, no political, partisan comments, no bashing others, etc.) There is a very simple counter showing the deaths live: I have been watching that for a week now and very sad to see how the counter speeds up every day.  No idea, how  it will end guys, but doesn't look good. For me, every death is a death, there are no important or not important ones. I'm kind of weirded out by the counter in the message above; I couldn't find any data on where their numbers are coming from and it doesn't seem like an obvious part of Chillio's business… Sweden did not do a lockdown. If you go by for a catastrophic scenario in the US: Honestly, I picture these people in front of a truck and the driver deliberately driving into them with the intent to save another person's life… does that make any sense to do? It does not to me. I appreciate the knee-jerk response to protect each other. But I cannot understand the idea of deliberately - with determination and opportunity to reflect – undermining and injuring the lives of 8 people to try to save 1 live… and that’s in a catastrophic scenario that is unlikely to occur. In a less catastrophic scenario, it wouldn’t be 8 people, it would be so many more. I say open up, show respect for other people’s boundaries, and plan to protect more vulnerable areas such as nursing homes and hospitals.

NY, NJ and MI together have more Covid-19 deaths than the entire rest of the United States. The top ten states have 72% of the cases and 76% of the deaths. New York state is in sixth place among global deaths. Good job!! Why? BLUE states and BLUE cities with BLUE administrations. Coincidence is cause, is that not correct? Covid-19 is NOT a US national problem. The United States, Italy, Spain and Germany together have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and more Covid-19 deaths than the entire rest of the world combined. Covid-19 is NOT a “global” pandemic. Shutting down the entire US and global economies was driven by the speculative and erroneous theories of “experts” that Covid-19 spread exponentially when the data was clearly second order. Much like IPCC’s RCP 8.5, a computer model stacked on assumptions with a 0.1% connection to reality. Then the public and politicians were stampeded to the precautionary principle by a fake news MSM propaganda machine intent on getting Trump. New York (especially New York), New Jersey, and Massachusetts all have a lot of cases, and a lot of deaths.  And that is skewing things a bit when you start looking at the country as a whole.  Michigan does too - and that might warrant some investigation.  California is also a larger state in terms of area - it's not as much of a concern to me as the three east coast states. But you're right.  The media is focusing on these bad areas and then that is putting fear in the rest of Americans.  The other states, aren't necessarily that bad.  Not great, but not in the same situation as New York.  Illinois has 39,658 cases and 1,795 deaths - that's not exactly a shining declaration.  But Texas has 22,806 cases and only 593 deaths - that's really not that bad. I didn't have a problem with the governments in the country shutting everything down.  I think that was the right move.  At the time, the data from China and Italy was saying that it was going to get bad if we didn't do something.  I don't fault governments and doctors and smart people that the governments turned to help make these decisions for making that decision.  But I think the models turned out to be wrong (and that happens, ask any scientist if the results of an experiment behaved exactly as their first model indicated... most of the time they don't). At the very least, we don't know if the models were right or wrong, because we shut everything down before the virus had a chance to really take hold.  So we don't know if social distancing caused the numbers to be a lot lower than we expected or if the virus just doesn't behave like we thought it would. That's why I think you need to start opening some things up, cautiously.  I would only open things up where you have excess vacant hospital capacity - in case things do go south quickly.  And with the caveat that those places that open up might have to be shut down again.  But we need the data to help figure this out. Now, obviously there are certain areas - New York being one of them, with New Jersey and Massachusetts not too far behind - that are too overwhelmed at the moment to even think about opening up.  And there are probably other areas - like Illinois, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania, probably most of the states - that probably need to take a few more weeks and re-evaluate their situation.  But there are a handful of states that can probably open things up a bit and see what happens. If social distancing is not what caused lower than expected numbers, then we wrecked the economy and continue to wreck the economy for no reason.  We need to find out if that is the case When this all started I remember seeing a few doctors commenting that for most people the symptoms would be mild. They were not the ones standing in front of banks of microphones. There were undoubtedly many medical professionals who were skeptical, but remained silent considering the way skepticism is treated in the climate change world. Why trash your career over something that you cannot change and will blow over by the end of the year? Skeptics are marginalized, demonized, threatened, disemployed and the lying, fact free, science illiterate, fake news MSM just piles on. The US Covid-19 asymptomatic ratio runs over 85%. That means 85% of the cases don't end up in the hospital or morgue. Very early on it was obvious that the very old with serious health issues were most at risk and most of the population was not. Couldn't tell that from the hysterical, panic inducing MSM. Money, politics, MSM, PC education have stifled the scientific process, a loss for all concerned. A free press has a responsibility to deliver balanced factual information to protect us from abusive and corrupt business and government. Who/what protects us from an irresponsible, abusive and corrupt press? You are correct. This not a global pandemic. It is a predominantly, developed, and/or affluent nation pandemic. There is a good reason for that. I wrote a paper explaining the reason and what can be done about it. I tried to email the paper with literature references to POTUS, WHO, governors, publications. They are all too busy to even open the emails because of the pandemic. I guess they might read the emails after the pandemic is over but then they won't need them. It is shocking to see how worthless our multi-trillion dollar communication technology is if you cannot submit a crucial suggestion to anyone in the United States. I even called the FBI to see if they can break the communication logjam. I could not get past the switchboard. ""our department does handle such issues""  even after explaining the life-saving implications. I grew up in the third world and migrated to the USA. So I have a special insight. It is a nightmare for me to see the unnecessary carnage. citation needed on climate change not existing? (this article does use a primary source, a human who works on this topic and the general scientific community's outlook on the endpoint) The virus itself won't likely blow over by the end of the year, just the pandemic state will. Untill there are vaccines, it won't ever go away. I consider myself a skeptic because I don't accept any claim untill evidence is provided. My family has sent me unfact-checked articles and I've had to ask them to show me the bibliogrphy. Pseudoscience is everywhere and it is important to ask for that citation when someone presents a claim. Looking into it using source methods will help you fight irresposible journalism and clickbait nonsense. Primary sources and finding those lowest roots of the evidence are great was to check the validity of something. Can I read the paper? I may not be a science journal but I do find it interesting! (look up Rio Journal, I think they accept well-reasarched papers from the general public) It's not a global pandemic????  Covid-19 knows no borders, will be spread via carriers of the virus travelling  through out the world.  Currently, it will be contained by the infected dying, developing an immunity, early identification with reliable testing and quarantine.  Eventually and hopefully, a vaccine will work to immunize most people...but then there's always the anti-vaxers who will depend on the herd immunity.  So it may never totally disappear. And it's mainly the ""blue"" states that are heavily hit, implying some political connection?  These are coastal states, either larger in size or more condensed populations, receiving thousands of travelers bringing in the virus. There's a lot of countries around the world showing the virus has reached them, plus we can safely assume that there are some countries that are not yet set up to collect the numbers.

This infection is very confusing as standard protocol for ventilator settings are counter to how ARDS patients are treated. Italian doctor said in the beginning, they intubated too quickly.  They all try their most to avoid ventilator now.  By NYC data, 88% of Covid-19 patients put on ventilator DIED. COVID-19 patients have very low oxygen levels in blood. Normally, if oxygen is low, CO2 is elevated because not blowing it off. But Covid-19 patients have low oxygen but normal carbon dioxide. This almost defies known physiology.   Patients in respiratory distress struggle hard to breathe and usual get exhausted in those efforts so they put on ventilator.  But these doctors described some patients as ""happy hypoxics"". They have very low oxygen but seem very alert, talking and with no distress. So the one common early mistake was intubating patients too soon. Many are now treated with high flow oxygen instead of ventilator. When maxing oxygen and patient continues to get worse, really struggling to breathe and in distress, then ventilator required."

A good start is to read all of the articles posted on LiveScience.com - they are updating as fast as new information becomes available.  As with any evolving topic, we are all learning on a daily basis. (side note: I edited the original topic to read ""historic"" rather than ""biblical"" plague, to avoid the almost inevitable religious arguments that arise - we've already had to trim some from this thread -our policy is to maintain adherence to scientific principles in all discussions.) You poor dear. It can be frustrating to not know that facts. So, here is my take from facts (research papers going back to 1995) : - Virus made the zoonotic jump from bats (mammals) to humans (mammals) - The vector (method of contact/exposure) was droppings in the bat's caves when people went in to harvest them for food/sale - Inhalation of dried bat guano was probably most likely route of infection - Due to China being a communist regime doctors/nurses were fearful of stating that this disease existed because it would make the harvesting and eating of bats a bad rap for communism because there's not supposed to be poverty as everyone is equal so the public acknowledgement of this situation was kept hidden until infection became rampant - It is a new virus meaning we don't have any prior immunity like we have from the multiple flu viruses that circulate each season - Infection is worse on people with poor immune systems - Infection is not so bad on healthy people - Have good hygiene, wash hands, keep them away from your face....get a cut or a wound....treat it and bandage it - Eat nutrient rich foods like black beans, rice, peanut butter (if you aren't allergic) and chia seeds because they provide all the essential amino acids and fatty acids our bodies need - they also keep the gut healthy so nutrients are better absorbed - Take Vitamin C (if symptoms show up....4000mg every two hours until you start having loose stools, then you know your body is saturated with C. We don't make it, we don't store it and we don't get near enough in our diets) - Take D3 per regular dosage - Drink water....not soda, not tea, not energy drinks.....WATER Since our medical professionals around the world need time to develop a vaccine the best we can do for ourselves and our loved ones is to stay as healthy as we can. If you hear stories in the news about medics, nurses or doctors getting this virus and dying what ever age they are remember their jobs are demanding, they work 12 hour shifts, their immune systems are taxed with exposure to all types of pathogens (viruses and bacteria) and they may have had underlying health condition. So, use common sense, and take care of yourself.  Best of luck to you and yours. Thank you, s Thank you so much! You are half right. Don't take vitamins for no reason. If you think you have a deficiency, talk to your doctor and you may be able to get bloodwork done. I had a vitamin D deficiency, but I got a PRESCRIBED MEDICINE to help. Otherwise, you should have enough on a normal diet. Please don't try to get loose stools. Diarrhea is your body's way of saying there is something wrong. Does anyone recall or remember, that before the internet, the premise and consensus was, that the stupidity, ignorance and  contention amongst us, was due to the lack of information? THAT was a good one. I stated loose stools only in reference to Vitamin C saturation. It is the body's response to having enough. I also stated, if you read it all, the need for plenty of water. It's false panic incited by the fake news mass media out to get Trump. The media seems to want Trump out but I would not call this a false panic. It took China extreme measures to bring it under control but the western countries are hamstrung due to faulty advice from experts. It's not about China. What's up with Spain, Italy,  France and UK?? All the developed countries including Spain, Italy, France, the UK, in general, have higher infection rates primarily due to closed ventilation systems.

Also, what is sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing for those who supposedly recovered and are ""immune"".  I read that some of these antibody tests are not actually testing for presence of Covid-19 antibodies but elevated IgG and other immunoglobulins. Wouldn't these be elevated with other viral infections? That is correct, I agree. I commented on several blogs that testing is impractical and of very limited value in determining who is not infected because the person can get infected soon after the test. There are problems with testing.  It's a      one-shot.  What we need is a fast acting wearable virus detector,      like a dosimeter.  They could be hung at gates and in enclosed      areas too.

What an excellent question. I could speculate based on how long Coronavirus lives outside of the body (on surfaces), but I'd prefer an expert to chime in on this topic. In the interim, the WHO guidance document of March 24, 2020 says that the body is not generally considered to be infectious, but wisely cautions people not to touch or kiss the corpse for the same distancing purposes employed throughout. It would make sense that the virus remains viable for a time on the deceased person. It is important to note that as the world's knowledge grows about the virus, recommendations may change. May be answer to stop this virus spread lies there ..For some people we have signs and for some 2e don't have ... I guess it is.dependent on some variable of living ..If some expert can let us know how long it cam survive in dead.pepple or what happens then it will be great The virus needs living cells to replicate.  At death, cells start dying.  How long it takes for all cells of mucous membranes and lungs (sites most likely to spread virus) to die is not known. It is unfortunate that panic about this virus creates bad situations when comes to burial. In India a prominent doctor died of Covid-19 after caring for patients. Local villagers blocked access to cemetary so his casket could not be interred fearing they would be infected.  The casket itself would not be infectious and body locked inside could not spread disease. The same thing happened in Egypt. It is proper to be very careful handling body of recently deceased person. But nothing infectious about a body sealed in coffin.  Education and information are needed to help communities understand. During Ebola, they didn't have coffins or caskets to bury bodies of victims of infections. So corpses were burned to prevent spread of very deadly virus."

Data from the spread of US cases could help answer that. ,"More data on mild and asymptomatic cases is desperately needed. I don't understand why everyone is overlooking the diamond princess data! It was a rare opportunity to test everyone potentially infected in a community. By looking at the stats we get a clear picture that roughly half of cases have no symptoms. It kills 2% and is unstoppable.  Eventually, we will all become immune to it either through infection or vaccination. Surely everything was deemed as unstoppable till we made the medicine to beat the disease/virus? Pretty sure your percentage of death rate is incorrect.  I believe they are now saying closer to 4% Let's hope so but that's only a maybe at this time since there's a possibility that those who have recovered have become infected again. So immunity may not be a sure thing. Then there's the possibility of the disease mutating. True for the stoppable diseases but some have no vaccine and others are nearly impossible to develop inoculations for due to the number of strains and mutations. Should be very careful using Stanford's data on Santa Clara residents. It has not been peer reviewed and has some serious problems about sampling. People were recruited using Facebook Ad. People wanting to know their status are more motivated to volunteer. Self-selection is a problem. But is no way a random testing.  Only people active on Facebook would have participated. This is not a good slice across a population. Lastly, I see no evidence that researcher ascertained whether multiple participants may have come from same household (family, roommates, etc.)  If multiple samples from same household, more likely to get infected and make incidence much higher. Data just reported from NYC from antibody testing indicates that percent of population is 12%-18%. This is significantly lower than Stanford study. The latest figures now show the death rate to be at 1/2%  which is comparable to the flu which comes every year. When comparing this to the flu, it depends on what you are comparing to. From the best I can tell (maybe someone can set me straight) the flu is not always diagnosed strictly on a positive flu test.  You can walk into a doctor's office, present with flu like symptoms in the middle of flu season, and the doctor may diagnose it as flu without a test. The CDC uses some type of formula to determine how many people actually have the flu - or at least that's how I view it. In the 2018-2019 season the 35,520,883 number doesn't necessarily mean that 35,520,883 people were tested for the flu and came back as positive.  I'm not sure if the 16,520,350 number is positive flu tests.  The 490,561 hospitalizations are probably true positive flu tests, or at least I'd come nearer to believe that all of those tested positive for the flu.  But there were definitely more than 490,561 that would have tested positive for the flu.  But how many?  We don't know. Until you know the number of positive flu tests and how many of that subset died you really can't compare it to the number of positive covid-19 test and how many of that subset died. Either way, covid-19 has already killed more than the 34,157 the flu killed in 2018-2019.  And then consider, that 34,157 number you are using is probably a lot smaller, because you can really only count deaths that came from real positive flu tests. The only thing you can really compare it to is the mortality rate - number of deaths out of an entire population. Flu: 34,157 deaths out of 320,000,000 people is a mortality rate of 0.0107% Covid-19: 49,963 deaths out of 320,000,000 people is a mortality rate of 0.0156% That might not seem like a lot, but it is more.  And it will continue to grow.  Is it more than the flu?  Yes.  Worth the panic?  That's debatable. You also have to consider that there's no vaccine for covid-19, but there is for the flu.  The flu has been around for years... Covid-19 is new, so this means that the human body just hasn't seen anything like Covid-19 to base any semblance of an immune response from.  So, knowing that, we knew Covid-19 was going to kill more people than the flu.  If Covid-19 winds up killing 70,000 to 90,000 people I'm not sure if that is all that unexpected. And as I've stated several times.  The numbers in New York City are way out in left field and really threw the models for a loop.  I think there's definitely something going on in New York City (and to some extent the whole New England region) that is spreading this virus for than in other areas of the country.  If the number of deaths in New York City had stuck to what was happening throughout the rest of the country, then that would probably be about 10,000 fewer deaths.  Obviously that didn't happen in New York City, but it's worth microscoping some of the numbers coming out of New York City and when all is said and done a study probably needs to be done to figure out what happened in New York City with this virus to help prevent that from happening again. Unfortunately, less than half of those over 65 get flu vaccine as recommended in USA and far fewer adults under 65.   The CDC mixes a concoction of various strains they predict will be active each flu season. Last 10 years, the effectiveness has been less than 50% most years Deaths each years in USA vary quite a bit. CDC has strong surveillance of flu but deaths are only counted if Influenza is recorded on death certificate.  The lowest number of deaths was 2011-2012 season with just 12,000 with vaccine 47% effective.  Highest number of death was 2017-2018 season with 61,000 with vaccine effectiveness just 38%. So with less than 50% people vaccinated and effectiveness of vaccine less than 50%, flu would appear to not be serious at all if looking just at deaths. However, CDC also estimates burden of flu which includes days lost from work for people sick, etc.  Vaccination seems to lessen the overall burden on society even with low effectiveness."

So Covid-19 supposedly jumped from bats to humans in China. How are tigers and pet cats catching Covid-19? REVISION:  CDC Press release.  The virus may have been transmitted to this cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home. Second cat:  The owner of the cat tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs. Another cat in the household has shown no signs of illness. ""Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding."" Same with tigers in zoo. They never said if zookeepers had tested positive.  No visitors to zoo and no visitors to home under social distancing. They are telling us that humans cannot catch it from their pets but pets can catch from humans. Can we believe that since virus already transferred from animal to human once? There are many coronaviruses out there including cause of common cold. My dog was vaccinated for a coronavirus infecting dogs.  Could it be these new animal infections are being misdiagnosed as Covid-19?  (No, Chinese actually infected cats with virus from Wuhan so same virus). Possibly. There are only a few known human coronaviruses and most have the potency of a common cold. It may well be that the test we use on people don't work as well at identifying this specific disease in cats. Just found scientific paper about experiments  using Covid-19 the Chinese performed using on ferrets, cats, dogs, ducks, chicken and pigs.   They inonculated the noses of animals with actual virus discovered in Wuhan. They found ferrets got mildly sick. On autopsy (after euthanasia), the ferrets had virus in nose, throat, tonsils but nothing in lungs. Cats got mildly sick (they were young cats 6 months to 9 months old) . On autopsy (after euthanasia), the cats had infection in nose, throat, tonsils and also lungs. They also found that cats placed in cage next to infected ones, also got infected. So I do not believe humans cannot catch it from infected pet cats. Don't let your cat lick you. Dogs, ducks, pigs and chicken were not susceptible. So would seem that humans COULD catch Covid-19 from their pet cats and ferrets but not dogs or pigs."

Some of what is dismissed as ""conspiracy theory"" is simply a different opinion based on different, but valid, background knowledge.  Doctors are generally NOT trained in herbology, nor do they keep up with the latest medical research for everything that might be relevant to all their patients. Doctors are required to keep up with pharmaceutical knowledge but they do not have time or particular incentive to keep up with research related to herbs, supplements and diet. So when we read blanket negative statements about non-drug remedies but we know better, because we have done our own research, we may view the propagandists with suspicion. For example, below is research on concentrated elderberry  juice that shows that elderberry does indeed have antiviral and immune-boosting effects, contrary to the article at LiveScience. Another, more recent study done in Australia had travelers take elderberry capsules or placebo before and during travel and then compared people in both groups who came down with colds. Elderberry reduced the severity of the symptoms and reduced recovery time by two days on average. Does that mean elderberry will stop you from getting coronavirus? Nobody has done that research yet. Should you take it? Why not? It's entirely up to you - not the government, YET, thank God! From : ""...We evaluated the antiviral effect of concentrated juice of elderberry (CJ-E) on the human influenza A virus (IFV). CJ-E had a relatively strong effect on IFV-infected mice, although its anti-IFV activity was weak in a cell culture system. The in vivo anti-IFV activities of the fractions were determined after separating CJ-E by ultrafiltration and anion-exchange chromatography. Oral administration of the high-molecular-weight fractions of CJ-E to IFV-infected mice suppressed viral replication in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs), and increased the level of the IFV-specific neutralizing antibody in the serum, as well as the level of secretory IgA in BALFs and feces. Fr. II from high-molecular-weight fraction HM, which contained acidic polysaccharides, showed relatively strong defense against IFV infection. We conclude that CJ-E had a beneficial effect by the stimulating immune response and preventing viral infection. "" While not a human study, humans have been taking elderberry for centuries to help with colds and flu. While they might have all been deluded, they also might NOT have been. Furthermore, elderberry has also been used in jams, preserves and drinks for centuries. Elderberry is food (unlike donuts or french fries... but I digress). There is no harm in taking elderberry. If it keeps you from getting really sick, you won't need to see the doctor. Quarantine yourself and no harm done. Don't go to work with a contagious disease whether it's coronavirus or something else.  If you do get really sick, then go seek medical attention. So how is elderberry a dangerous folk remedy, and dangerous to whom? Not only does the NIH have supporting literature on the benefits of elderberry, but a host of others do as well, including the University of Maryland and the Israeli Defence Forces. There is literally no downside to taking elderberry syrup; it could possibly save a life, or at the very least, prevent severe illness. It was hugely irresponsible for the writer of this article to include elderberry when I am certain that she did zero research on its benefits. It has shown profound effectiveness against both influenza A and B, the common cold, and infectious bronchitis, which is caused by a chicken coronavirus. Absolutely agree with everything said in previous comments, there're thousands of studies done on antivaral,antioxidant, immune-enchancing properties of Vitamin C alone. And having said that there's no vaccine, they still keep on stressing how it's wrong to use vitamins and herbs to increase the body's ability to fight the virus. Just stop regurgitating the same nonsense and start thinking rationally. And if you don't see the real science-backed research behind natural components, it doesn't mean there's none, it just means you chose to ignore it. Anybody who is interested in taking large doses of Vitamin C by mouth should read the following article published in 1981, which is available online. ""The Method of Determining Proper Doses of Vitamin C for the Treatment of Disease by Titrating to Bowel Tolerance"" by Robert F. Cathcart III  M.D. I have now been taking large doses of Vitamin C by mouth for several months as part of a strict weight-reducing diet. I feel my general health has improved, both because of substantial weight loss and because of  the use of various Vitamin and Mineral supplements.  I have no idea if gradually increasing the dosage of Vitamin C will help protect me from Coronavirus, but as I am elderly and have many health problems I feel I have nothing to lose. Bought In bulk, in powder form, both Ascorbic Acid and Sodium Ascorbate are still relatively cheap. The tablets are a rip off, at least in the UK. Another article of interest I have found is ""Clinical Guide to the Use of Vitamin C"" published 1988. This is a summary of the work of Frederick R. Klenner, M.D. by Lendon H. Smith M.D.  It includes Dr Klenner's  account of successfully treating many cases of viral pneumonia with large doses of Vitamin C. To equate taking elderberry with drinking bleach is preposterous.  The efficacy of elderberry, either as syrup or a tea made from dried berries,in dealing with flu, has been proven in randomized studies, as for example reported here I and several friends have been drinking elderberry tea every day for the last decade and, in sharp contrast to our past experience, have never during that period caught a cold or come down with flu; and one of those friends had been diagnosed with COPD. It may not work on all viruses, or it may, or it may work only on some, but it appears to have no side effects and it could be of great benefit in the current situation. Let me add: elderberry is a superb expectorant. Here is a study on elderberry and the flu, showing that it is effective, and how and why. While coronavirus is not the flu, at least some of the effects of elderberry may still be effective, at least partially, against coronavirus. Interesting Shirley49 Also, there's all Linus Pauling's research on Vitamin C - Thought some may dismiss Pauling's research & work, many do still use Vit C & Lysine to help with Vascular health. Whether he got it all 100% spot on or not is one thing, but I think his Vit C research has a something in it, for sure. Yes, while there are concerns with immune system upward modulation being a liability with a cytokine storm, Elderberry, unlike some general immune system stimulants, has a well-known action whereby it inhibits the entry of the virus into human cells (some call a form of ""melting"" away the spikes). And, while Elderberry may enhance cytokine formation/action, we 1) don't know for sure, as that comes from  approx. 18 year-old in vitro or animal studies, and 2) though we don't know for sure, the cytokines in play for Elderberry are thought to be anti-inflammatory. Even then CKs are not so simple, as while IL-4, IL10, IL-13 are thought of as anti-inflammatory, IL-1, IL-12, IL-15 are pro-inflammatory, CKs can be either and change. Consider that IL-22 is anti- in the bowels, but pro- for the skin. There really does need to be some focused research regarding COVID-19 and Elderberry. But, my leaning is that it would be beneficial. Interesting. That is very promissing. Is there any reasarch on it into common cold viruses? Not Rhinovirus but Coronavirus caused colds. I think becuse of the protien and genetic similarity to other Coronaviruses that it could pertain more to the topic. I'm not one for non-drug treatments and remedies, but I do like myself some elderberry tea every once in a while. It would be useful if we could isolate various chemicals in the elderberry that boost the immune system. If you notice, cell culture does not have an imunne system, but mice do, so it may not have antiviral properties but helps your body's reaction."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/a-path-out-of-the-pandemic.2148/,A path out of the pandemic,"How are we going to get out of this coronavirus pandemic?  One thing is for certain, we're not going to social distance this virus out of existence.  I don't know if the public at large thought that if we social distanced ourselves the virus would eventually go away.  No, that is not the point of social distancing.  Social distancing was meant as a measure to help prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.  The actual act of of social distancing is preventing us from really moving forward with battling the virus.  That's not to say that all social distancing measures should be removed right now, it's just saying that the longer a population uses social distance as their primary means to battle this virus... the longer you're going to be practicing social distancing. A few things to look at before going in-depth with all of this: Why are 80% of the people that are being tested coming back as negative (don't have the virus) in all of the molecular (active) tests?  I don't have anything to compare this to and I'd love to know how this stacks up against other viruses and diseases testing.  This may in fact be the expected behavior.  But just the number... seems high to me.  Are we testing too many people that don't need to be tested?  Is the virus not that contagious?  Is this molecular test really that accurate?  Are we double dipping too much in the number of tests administered? Are unique individuals being tested twice, thrice, or even more often?  Keep in mind... just because an individual tests negative for the virus, that doesn't mean they won't contract it later.  It just seems to me that a lot of people are being tested and coming back as negative. The governments (United States) of the country have been ridiculed for their lack of response to this.  Some of that is warranted.  Although, from best I can tell, the ridicule comes from the lack of these molecular tests.  But I would argue that the ridicule should be aimed at the lack of planning in response to this virus.  A widespread molecular test would only be feasible if you could test EVERYONE in the country at the same time.  That would be 320 million+ tests all done at largely the same time.  This was never going to be possible - the governments (federal, state, local) should have realized that this was never going to be feasible.  Instead the goal of the government should have been focusing on reliable antibodies testing.  Money should have been thrown at developing and testing a reliable antibodies test so that you could push that testing out widespread, 6 to 8 weeks after this all started.  Antibodies testing may or may not mean immunity... but it would at the very least tell you how widespread the virus has reached.  If a percent of your population has the antibodies but never experienced any symptoms or had very mild symptoms, then that would alleviate some of the fear that goes along with this virus.  And just to note, the fact that 80% of people that are being tested come back negative for this virus would seem to contradict some of the antibodies studies that suggest that this virus is more widespread, that is something that needs to be studied. Further the governments should have recognized that basing this test at a state level was much to broad.  A state level test might work in the smaller states of New England, but as you get more and more out towards the Midwest, the testing needs to be a bit more finer.  Doing it by county is much too small (there are over 3,000 counties in the United States).  I would suggest doing it by US congressional districts - mainly because these are already defined.  It's not exactly fair to take a state like Texas and treat it all as one.  Is it fair to the residents of Pecos, TX to have to suffer through restrictions because the number of cases are high in Houston?  This is another miss from how the governments should have been planning for this. Just to be clear, this is not a political issue.  I'm not saying either party is to blame for this.  There are states with governors from both parties and none of them would appear to have done any planning like this.  I'm saying the governments as a whole failed in this planning.  But also to be fair... hindsight is 20/20. The problem we are facing right now is an extreme lack of data.  We've social distanced ourselves to the point that no new data is coming in.  Are people immune to it?  Is the virus as contagious as we once believed?  Are the symptoms that bad?  We're not going to get any new information until we change things up a bit. Now, seeing as how a widespread reliable antibodies test is probably not viable - at least in the short term, how can this situation be remedied?  I would focus my attention to the percentage of hospitalizations of confirmed cases.  Or if you really wanted to take it a step further, the number of people in the ICU of confirmed cases.  The number of confirmed cases isn't telling us a whole lot right now.  You can have a confirmed cases, but not affected by it very much.  You could have a case of the virus, but not be confirmed (because you didn't get tested).  You could have a case of the virus and not be showing any symptoms.  You could have had the virus weeks ago and be recovered.  But if you're in the hospital - or specifically in the ICU - and you have the virus, then you have a really bad case of the virus.  That's not to say that it's peachy having it while you self-isolate at home.  But if you've got it, and you're able to stay at home, then at worse it's probably like a really bad case of the flu. Then to add on to this, I would again look at this data in terms of US congressional districts.  Again, this would have ramifications in how to potentially treat a town like Pecos, TX vs. Houston, TX.  If you've got a better way of dividing this up - I'm all ears. I would also weigh in hospital capacity (or probably more specifically ICU capacity) in those divided areas and how much excess capacity those areas have. All of this together would tell you which areas could potentially be opened back up.  If an area has a relatively low percentage of hospitalizations - then it stands to reason that that area is not experiencing a widespread outbreak.  If that area also has excess hospital and ICU capacity, then this would seem to be a prime area where things could be cautiously opened back up.  That doesn't mean that an outbreak won't happen in that area.  But that area would appear to have hospital capacity to treat people if the number of cases start to rise.  And if a large outbreak then happens, it may require the area to be closed down again.  But either way, it tells you something.  It gives you more data that you can feed into the model about this virus. To attempt to model some of this, I took data from the John Hopkins website - from April 21st - and tried my best to fit this into a useful display of information.  There's a few deficiencies with the JHU data.  Mainly, it doesn't give data for active cases in each state.  It only gives information about confirmed cases in each state.  It also does not give information about recovers in each state.  Calculating active cases should be a simple matter of ( ).  Also the JHU website lists deaths by counties or city and not so much by state. Since I don't have recovered cases and deaths for each state (and this could easily be a reporting issue and not necessarily with how JHU presents the information), what I did was took a percentage of active cases to confirmed cases from the total US population and applied that to each state's confirmed case number.  (816,240 total US confirmed cases at the time I took this information, 44,228 deaths, 75,177 recovers ... subtract all of that out and you get 696,835 ... 696,835 divided by 816,240 equals about an 85% active case rate.  Multiply each state's confirmed case by 0.85 to get a ""guess"" at how many active cases exist in each state.  Kentucky had 3050 confirmed cases, multiplied by 0.85 equals 2603.83 ""active cases guess"").  This is fudging the math I know - but it's all I've got to work with.  If there's a website that gives me the an accurate number of active cases and the number of active cases in the hospital for each state, that would definitely be preferable.  I also took a snapshot of the hospitalizations from JHU for each state one day (April 16) and then again on a later date (April 21) and in some states the hospitalizations decreased... this told me that the hospitalizations figures JHU is reporting is a function of active cases and is not a growing number of total hospitalizations ever within the state - although I suppose that information could be a reporting issue explaining the reduction.  The bottom line of it, I really need more accurate and better defined data to build this... but this is the best I've got.  Also, some states did not report hospitalizations on the JHU website, so I had to remove them - I think Indiana was one such state - there were others but that's one I remember. The information looks like this: Now, looking at this table, this shows that Kentucky is actually faring pretty poorly with 40% of their cases being hospitalized.  But also likewise, Washington state only has 4.71% of their cases in the hospital, but that's still 503 people.  Does Washington state have the hospital capacity to handle 503 (presumably ICU) patients with excess capacity?  (I really don't know).  Again, this is probably why a more granular data set would be preferable... like US congressional districts, but this is the information I have to work with.  I would arbitrarily consider any state that has less than 20% of their cases in the hospital and less than 100 total hospitalized would be areas that could potentially handle being opened up a bit.  That would be the states of: Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Hawaii, West Virginia, North Dakota, Vermont, South Dakota, and Guam (not a state, but the information was there).  Maybe the ""under 100 total hospitalized"" is way too low... I don't know, I'd leave that up to people with a bit more knowledge of this information.  And again, if this was divided up in congressional districts then this might yield different results.  While the hospitalization rate in Kentucky is at 40% for the whole state, that might not be true for the far western end of the state where there's not a lot of densely populated areas.  Again, I'm kind of assuming that all hospitalizations are ICU cases - that may not be the case and having a true number of ICU cases would probably be better. As those states or areas open up, see what happens.  Monitor those areas for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, what happens in those areas?  No doubt the number of confirmed cases will likely go up, but to what degree?  And is it manageable?  And then you start to roll this out to other areas, which hopefully have seen their hospitalization numbers decrease while this monitoring is going on.  Or hopefully you get reliable antibodies testing available by then and you could start to base this opening up on which areas have seen a widespread number of cases. This would be what my plan for opening things up would look like.  And this is where the lack of planning by the governments seem to be hurting.  But I just don't see where the governments really had any plans to combat this.  And again I want to point out that the actual numbers I used may not be the best numbers to use - but it's all I had.  The logic behind using those numbers (whatever they might actually be) still remains the same.  More accurate numbers is going to lead to a more accurate model. This episode ain't over, and it's going to be hell to analyze.  We traded our normal society life temporarily, to lower the death count of our most vulnerable, until we could come up with viable treatments.  Modern medicine has allowed formally fatal conditions to become chronic conditions now.  This increases the number of vulnerable people. Just the vulnerable can overwhelm our present lean system.  And a bunch is added every year. This delayed the normal population progression of the event.  This alone will complicate the comparison to other outbreaks.  And judging the strategy. The data and actions will be debated for decades.  But we will experience the effects. The event is truly historic.  And worrisome. Just to add to this.  I think my data is either outdated, inaccurate, or I misinterpreted it. Saw a report out of Kentucky today.  There are 3,481 total cases there.  1,335 have recovered.  191 have died from this virus.  Subtract all of that out and you get 1,955 active cases in Kentucky. That same press release stated that there were 302 in the hospital.  And 163 of those are in ICU. So that puts Kentucky's hospitalization rate at 15%, that's well off of the 40% I stated in my post.  If you looked at ICU cases, that's 8%. So I'm really starting to think that the data I used to make that table is wrong or needed to be updated.  But the procedure is still the same, just feed it in with the correct data.  I don't suppose anybody knows where I can get a hold of this type of data for every state in a single location, with a pretty ribbon on it? Isn't that data suppose to be on the CDC site?  I have tried to use that site before, but I have problems navigating it. But it will be just a snapshot.  We'll have to wait for awhile, to make true sense of it. It may be on the CDC website... but I can't find it.  Maybe I'm not looking hard enough.  All I really see on the CDC website is a bunch of graphs where they probably used data like this to create.  But they don't actually provide the raw data. But... um... yea... it's always going to be a snapshot until we're talking about this event using past tense.  But that's the point of building models.  If you're waiting for this to be over before analyzing the data, you're going to be waiting a while... a long while.  The point of building models is watch trends and see what is happening now. OK, I found better data (I think) at: Although, it shows Vermont with 825 confirmed cases and 1,710 recovered.  Recovered cases can't be more than confirmed cases.  One thing that whole thing has illustrated... there's a severe lack of funneling data into one spot. But this data also shows the correct Kentucky information, so I'm going to assume that it's a bit more spot-on for currently active cases. Again, not all of this information is available for every state. Looking at how the data is distributed and without knowing the capacity and remaining capacity in each state's hospitals system.  I'd say any state that has less than an 11% hospital rate and less than 500 people in the hospital is probably safe to consider opening things up a bit. This would be the states: Montana, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Wisconsin, North Carolina, South Dakota, Arkansas, Rhode Island, and North Dakota This website also reports ICU numbers - although not a lot of states appear to report that.  But the information for that would be: Although, there's just really not a lot of data to go on here.  But of the states reporting, and of the states that would potentially be able to open up a bit, Maine reports the highest ICU rate with 4.4% of active cases for a total of 18 ICU.  Wisconsin has the most in ICU at 146 or 3% of their active cases.  Does Wisconsin have excess ICU capacity?  That might give them pause on opening things up. But if your state is listed in one of these tables and you're wondering why your state isn't opening up, I'd consider looking at where you fall in these tables and that might help you to understand why it's not opening up and what needs to happen before it can consider opening up. I'm guessing analyzing this data is a lot like the art of troubleshooting.  Troubleshooters are called in when previous attempts and mitigations have been tried.  This colors the current symptoms of the problem.  A good troubleshooter has to filter the previous attempts, to track down the actual problem. It will be a cluster-buster."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/bakersfield-california-doctors-dispute-stay-at-home-order.2201/,Bakersfield California Doctors dispute stay at home order,"These doctors are saying that it's pointless to lock down because of an exceedingly low death rate from Coronavirus.  They are citing 5000 test results.  Debunkers are claiming sampling error due to the fact the tests were conducted on people seeking the test.  The doctors also cite Sweden's no-lock down approach as being manageable, and without the overwhelming death spike that the media warns of.  Debunkers point out that Sweden has 22 deaths per 100k, as opposed to around 7 in other scandinavian countries. I think the sampling error is totally offset by the number of symptom free carriers that do not seek testing.  In Iceland, 50% of carriers are symptom free.  In the US, 3,300 people were tested in prisons, and 96% of carriers are symptom free.  If this amount of carriers are symptom free, then I agree the lockdowns are totally pointless, and are more medically harmful than helpful.  There is a high morbidity associated with unemployment and inactivity.  It's harmful psychologically and physically.  The higher death rate in Sweden is expected, and simply reflects a higher curve rather than a flatter curve.  The peak is not overwhelming and hastens herd immunity.  With an extremely low death rate, I'm a proponent of ""spiking"" rather than ""flattening"" the curve. From a highly skilled statistician friend of mine: ""It is increasingly looking like of all people who catch this, around 0.8-1% die (the ""IFR""). The 4% is only of hospitalized patients, but we are pretty sure way more people catch it than need a hospital. But we are also pretty sure that excess deaths have mysteriously jumped to a total that is almost double what the attributed Covid deaths are, presumably from lots of Covid deaths that aren't correctly attributed to it. "" Herd immunity WILL lessen the number, but it is still too early to predict immunity numbers with a high degree of certainty. In the meantime, no one wants to be part of the 2.6 million, nor have their parents, grandparents or friends succumb. Life is already short enough, and putting people at risk is something we are learning to avoid. I grew up in an age when seatbelts were used, everyone smoked everywhere and even drunk driving was considered pretty normal. Our society is evolving to protect our lives, for the better. These doctors are saying the numbers suggest .03% of people die.  There's no way to totally know until there's antibody testing.  If the figure is more like .03% and less like .8% then the protection of lives may require not locking down in the future with a disease like this - due to the lives lost through the morbidity of unemployment, inactivity, and a great recession or depression.  Even with .8%, a very high symptom free carrier rate means that .8% will affect the whole country anyway, so quarantining simply adds more problems and extends the suffering.  There's an argument for doing this until a vaccine comes out, but quarantining for an entire year or so (if that's how long this would take) is extremely damaging to lives in other ways.   For the lockdown to be effective, it may have to be much more extreme than even a Wuhan style lockdown, where the Gov't delivers food with sanitized packaging, etc. Oh - and by the way - with the ""sample bias"" errors they are debating...  You'd have to assume most sick people were tested for this bias to weigh in the favor of the debunkers.   If there's a large number of symptom free carriers, along with a number of sick people who were not tested, then the sample error would weigh heavily in favor of the argument these doctors are making, and even .03% is larger than the actual number.  I believe this is certainly the case. You may be right, but In order for me to be persuaded by your argument, you'll first have to provide satisfactory answers to a few questions. 1.  How is the government going to pay to have us stay at home for a minimum of a year and a half?  Are our mortgages going to be paid?  Bills and living expenses?   A quick jog with my calculator shows $1200 per month for 328 million Americans is 7 trillion dollars over 18 months.  And $1200 a month isn't enough to cover most people's living expenses and debts.  Essentially, most Americans will go bankrupt and most companies that rely on income (and last time I checked, I think that's just about all of them).  How would a company that was shuttered for 18 months start up again?  Where will the capital come from? What about people who have a mortgage on a five million dollar house?  Does the government pay for their debt while someone with a $75,000 house get a fraction of that?  Is that fair? And the cost that will eventually have to be paid.  Currently the US government shells out about half a trillion dollars a year on servicing our national debt, the total of which is currently around 80% of the budget.  If we continue as we're going now, 18 months from now we'll easily double that debt load.  That means that for every $18 you make, $1 will be going to pay for the national debt.  What if a more grave emergency comes along?  Do we double or triple that again? 2.  When will it ever be feasible to end the lockdown prior to the time a vaccine is discovered?  This contagion started presumable with a handful of people exposed in this country and within two months we were racking up 30,000 cases per day.  We will never be below a tiny handful of contagious people again.  The genie is out of the bottle.  So when would you consider it safe, wise or prudent  to open up the country? 3.  Why is it that you consider our only options being lockdown or full-on open with no safeguards?  An obvious alternative exists that no one seems to even be talking about: protect that small percentage of the population that is vulnerable to hospitalization or death and let the younger, healthier get on with their lives while maintaining an economy.  A small fraction of what we would pay with 18 months of lockdown could be far better spent on protecting the most  endangered people who would be the ones stretching our medical capabilities.  And who, thankfully, because of retirement mostly just happen to not be working contributors to the economy.  Are you certain that this alternative that would maintain the economy would create a significantly higher death toll than we have today?  Are you willing to stake the country's economy on your perception? In answer to your statement on 2.6 million deaths, I think your statistician friend is a little high (I calculated a .6% mortality rate), but either way, it's guesswork.  If you don't have the data you need to provide an answer, being the best statistician in the world isn't going to help you.   I know I'll get blowback for this but, it is true, these most vulnerable are vulnerable mostly because they are reaching the ends of their lives.  And while if they knew for sure they would die if we opened up the economy, they would probably scream bloody murder.  But right now, nobody knows for sure.  it's a gamble.  I'm 56 years old and think I can safely say that the country I grew up in would never have considered closing up shop under these conditions.   And I think the older generation would be even more surprised by it.  I wouldn't expect the country to close down for the chance to lower my risk of death, especially nearing the end of my life.  And I don't see that the generation that came before me would feel anything other than the same. When you ask the question, how would you feel if you or a loved one dies from the disease, that really isn't a fair question.  It's like asking someone if they would drive their car today if they knew they would die in an accident.  We take a calculated risk every day to whatever degree in order to have a normal life and are willing to throw the dice.  I mean, if I knew I would die by a car hitting me when I crossed the street in the coming year, I might just think long and hard about lobbying to outlaw all cars.  In other words, you can't remove the potential for ""reward"" in a hypothetical involving a risk and expect an answer that means anything. About four years ago a study was done that showed that men's testosterone has dropped a jaw-dropping 30% in the past 20 years.  What if our species has evolved to have two different types of brains--a masculine and feminine--for the purpose of determining what to do and how to deal with, well, everything.  That as a species these two brain types have in a way developed in order to perceive reality more accurately, together working as a more balanced, finely tuned preceptor than either of the two separately.   When you mention in your reply above that our society has evolved, has it?  Or are we perceiving things differently now because chemically we have changed.  I personally fall firmly on the masculine side of thinking, and when reality seems to become increasingly skewed away from the way you think, believe me you notice.  If it moves toward you it's just people being reasonable and you never notice.  This question has come to the fore right now with the virus and how we're dealing with it.  To me our current thinking just makes no logical sense whatsoever.  But I know for those whose mind is dominated by the ""yin,"" somehow the exact same situation perceives the current response as appropriate. But, really, is it such a reach with the extraordinary occurrence that male testosterone has dropped to a level never before seen that our species is chemically out of balance?  And if that's so, it might just be my responsibility right now as a ""yang"" to speak up when I see my society on the verge of  what I think is self-destruction from the increasing dominance of one side that has so rarely come to be cross examined. I believe that the lockdown can be ended and the virus spread can be reduced to an insignificant level if the mode of transmission is recognized. The HVAC in buildings is the major culprit. I wrote a 7-page report explaining why and tried to send it to all the authorities, WHO, POTUS, Governers, and others. None accept any emails or messages. They give automated replies full of gibberish and self adorations or no replies. If anybody is interested I have the report on my drive at:"

This is what everybody seems to forget about viruses. A healthy host means a successful environment for the virus to maintain its existence.  As this virus is new to Humans it has many weaknesses the principal one being that it is allowing the hosts to infect others before continuing to cause the host to become a fatality. This weakness is why the Wuhan testing and containment methodology may actually work. However, it relies on the asymptomatic carriers to spread the disease and public acceptance of a large number of fatalities Pretty sure I just read total opposite of that today.  I think it gets stronger. The virus is not trying to kill us. It may look that way from our perspective--but from the virus's perspective, it's just trying to replicate itself as many times as it can. For the virus, getting ""stronger"" means getting better at spreading, not getting better at killing. Killing your hosts before you can spread--or making them so sick that they isolate themselves--is a fatal mistake for any virus. That's why SARS didn't take off like this. It was *too* deadly, and as a result it could be contained and stamped out. COVID-19 hits the worst possible balance: It's deadly enough to kill millions, but not so deadly that it burns out its host pool before it can spread. Absolutely agree. It appears that a number of retroviruses have successfully become part of the human genome, and are expressed in the way we form our placenta compared with other mammals. That's real success for a virus - infecting every single possible host, and being reliably passed on every time! Well stated, thank you. I fail to see how this is a weakness. It is not a single organism and every virus cell is expendable. The fact it allows the host to infect others before killing the host is anything but a weakness. It eliminates the usual limitation on viruses which are too deadly to allow their own spread to continue far. The fact is that new or not, it doesn't appear to have weaknesses but an uncannily well-stocked bag of tricks which enable it to do what it will amongst the human population. Not exactly what one expects to see in a virus which has supposedly jumped species. However now some weeks after this article, it is clearly mutating far more than presumed, over 30 variants identified so far and still, very limited samples for that suggest many more are out there. It also appears to have been circulating amongst populations and not just in China for much longer. France has discovered there was a strain there well before it came from China or Italy and increasingly it appears to have been in the USA much longer than assumed or admitted.  The strange and never resolved vaping illness we saw last year, in fact, would appear to have been this. That was a very strange tale at the time and knowledgable people doubted it's veracity since vaping is not new, and nothing like it ever occurred before.  Nor has there been more heard about it in a while. Wuhan is just where it first to a serious hold and maybe that was due to having 'improved itself' enough to go on a rampage or because a conscious effort was involved in spreading it in Wuhan by some party or parties. That is all well and good for a natural virus. This one is anything but.  There have been conflicting reports but clearly there is an effort to keep a lid on the laboratory origins of this. One of the world's best Microbiologists, , who received a Nobel prize for the discovery of HIV has stated categorically it is the product of gene editing. There have been plenty of other such reports and the withdrawal of the claims in some cases doesn't change the science, just their courage in speaking about it. It has way too many tricks up its sleeve for a natural virus anyway.  Of course, nature tends to eliminate such artificial constructs but in the meantime, it has been 'programmed' to do a job and it seems fairly obvious that is not to give scientists a new fun game to play."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/why-not-antibiotics.1957/,Why not antibiotics?,"Antibiotics kills most of the bacteria in our body which may helps to boost the immune system to fight corona virus. ( reducing need of immune system to kill bacteria by using antibiotics for infected patients ) Some advance studies suggest that the gut bacteria control and maintain our immune system.  And our health.  Feed the gut bacteria properly, and they will take care of you. It's like farming now.  Raise the proper soil bacteria, and forget crop fertilization.  Activated sludge was a first use of such a principle.  Now farming is starting to use it.  A proper biomass environment. Maybe in the future, we take a weekly gut test, and the results recommend a selection for next week's diet.  Instead of scales. Most bacteria in our bodies are either beneficial or have no discernible effect on our bodies Antibiotics are often used in ways that aren't beneficial to patients. This history of over-prescribing them has helped build more strains of antibiotic resistant bugs. In cases where a patient is already in an at risk group for coronavirus (antibiotics will have no benefit against a virus) making them even more susceptible to future antibiotic resistant bugs could be very dangerous. Antibiotics kill both, good and bad bacteria in the body. They are a weapon of the last resort.  They can save lives and end it too. I learned it the hard way. I came face to face with death because antibiotics saved me from potential pneumonia but gave Cdiffilus in return, a deadly disease that conventional medicine cannot cure. Luckily I found an alternative medicine cure on an internet blog and decided to try it instead of going back to the people who gave me antibiotics. It worked like magic. Ever since that time I avoid going to doctors except for checkups but avoid their prescriptions. Some day, I might need help but so far I am doing fine."

There is an assumption that animal carcasses cannot host the virus. I am not convinced. It was created in a wet market in China selling dead animals for human consumption. Why are there so many cases in isolated businesses in industrial estates where other cases in neighboring businesses occurred? Please read my post titled “People Are Dying Of COVID Pneumonia Because Of Lung Temperature”.  It explains why Seniors are dying, people who live, work and commute for long periods in cold outdoor temperatures (Wuhan, European Lifestyles, New York etc.) and finally people who work in a refrigerated environments like the meat industry all have one thing in common, cold lungs that allow the coronavirus to replicate optimally.   Quite simply the virus can not multiply very well in warm lungs at or above 37C, that is why cold ventilators, fever reducing drugs are all contributing to severe pneumonia cases.  All those doctors and researchers are still under the impression that our respiratory tracts are not effected by breathing frigid air for long periods of time, they seem to need a lesson in heat exchange from the HVAC Industry. The largest predictor is time spent exposed to the infectious particles, which means the places of high risk include indoor locations with many people and less ventilation (than standing in a field would provide). Thus, churches, schools, buses, trains, restaurants, parties, etc. offer the most risk. Cool, moist environs do support a longer life for a virus outside of the host, and so meat packing plants are even more at risk. The workers are catching it from each other, not from the inert meat. Here is an excellent piece on transmission risks: ~LC"
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/virus-contaminated-food.1801/,Virus Contaminated Food.,"Can we get the Virus by eating food that has been contaminated with it? If not, why not? If so can it be contaminated by kitchen workers who have coughed or sneezed? If you heat the food, that should kill the virus. Lenya's link is excellent. Food has always been a major carrier for pathogens. If you are eating food raw, make sure it's well cleaned first. If you are eating cooked food, there are standards of heat at which most pathogens die (this is why we pasteurize milk in most places). Freezing will not always kill pathogens. Good luck out there! ~LC No question about it: Going out to eat or stopping by the local fast food is a likely way to catch the virus!  Remember, people don't know they are infected for up to 14 days!  Even with precautionary measures for food handling, if a worker has the virus it can easily be spread on many surfaces and transferred to consumers. This means grocery stores and food joints are the greatest generators of the spread in countries with lock downs. Everyone should be smart and do their part.  Stay home unless you MUST leave.  If it makes it easier, just remember 1 and 5 tested in US are infected and ~35% of closed cases end in death.  Is going to Wal-mart or McDonalds really worth risking your life and the lives of your loved ones? Your death rate is higher than the actual reported numbers, but I think it's clear that we are getting to the stage where everyone knows someone, even if indirectly, who has been hit hard or has passed from this. Many places offer online grocery services. While it is true that you may have to wait up to a week for delivery, these professional shoppers are doing us all a huge favor. Less families clogging supermarket aisles means less people transmitting coronavirus. It also helps keep the pro shoppers safer too. I am ordering only food with a long shelf life, leave it out overnight (use your garage if you have one), and then bring it in. I grew up when dinosaurs roamed the earth and the only ""fresh"" winter foods were cabbage, carrots, potatoes, turnips, onions and apples, - all of those are very easy to wash and can stay outside overnight with ease. Bagged salads are a good bet too, as it's so easy to wash the exterior of the bag. We're all in this together! ~LC Hey jonmike. I see your link, but I must be missing something, because I do not see where one finds ""closed cases"" from on the ArcGIS site. I am genuinely curious about this. I am not a statistician, and I suspect neither are 95% of our other forum users. Are closed cases based on hospital admissions? Worldometer provides a more easily digestible version, where the WHO estimates the overall death rate at 3.4% (1/10 of the number you postulate), which is still very sobering compared to the WHO's original 2% prediction. Predictably it jumps to 15% among those ill enough to be admitted to hospital. They also maintain a chart: Spain at 26% deaths among closed cases: Italy at a staggering 43%: Oddly they do not provide information on closed cases in the US. I've also been following the LiveScience article (updated daily): Numbers will continue to fluctuate until we reach the end point, and the bottom line is that this is a very dangerous time, particularly for the elderly, and people with underlying illnesses. I suspect that if the food in question is properly cooked and served hot, the likelihood of its being a vector is rather small.  Leftovers, cold-cuts, or serve-yourself situations...  are you really hungry? As a restaurateur, Mr Lopez-Alt's interest in food safety related the Covid-19 outbreak is commendable, but I believe he has erroneously concluded, as have many others  that it is only a respiratory virus spread primarily by inhalation of virus containing droplets expelled the coughs or sneezes of infected persons.  Common influenza is a well known example of such a virus.  Although flues can be quite infectious, they are nothing like this Covid-19 thing. However, the recent discovery of the Covid-19 virus in the stools of infected patients clearly indicate that it also has a gastrointestinal component. Gastrointestinal viruses typically originate in the virus shed through vomit and stools of infected individuals and spread through poor washroom and hand hygiene finding their way through contaminated hands and surfaces to be orally ingested (eaten) by the new victims. I believe Norwalk virus is an example of such a virus. Now, if we had hybrid virus that: 1.  could be spread, and contracted like both a respiratory virus and a gastrointestinal virus, 2. and then spared many of its victims serious symptoms so they would continue to circulate in society and spread the virus throughout the contagious phases of their infections, causing new victims to be infected either directly through virus inhaled by close contact  with coughing or sneezing individuals, or through ingestion of contaminated food We would have an extremely contagious virus such as this world has not seen in a very longtime, something that would behave a lot like the Covid-19 virus. Add the ability to develop potentially lethal acute respiratory syndrome in some of its victims and we have a very scary situation indeed.! Given the mild symptoms experienced my many victims, the true infection will always be grossly understated due to the large number of mild cases that will likely never report and never be tested. Much like the West Nile virus that way. With respect to food safety, I agree the Covid-19 virus is neutralized by cooking, but that doesn't mean that cooked food is not susceptible to re-contamination afterwards. Besides the practice of a high level of hand hygiene, I think it makes sense that restaurant staff handling and serving food after cooking wear masks to prevent it from being re-infected with respiratory droplets. Awesome! Thank you for having common sense!"

In the meantime, keep up with our COVID-19 here on our live updates page: And to learn about what's happening in the U.S., check out our America-specific updates page: Are the people buying toilet paper panicking or is it actually a good idea? Zoonotic Viruses From Animals With Core Temperatures Above Humans ***  Most colds and flus start in the respiratory track and are especially more prevalent in colder dry seasons (and air conditioning) where it is the cooler dryer respiratory track that is much more susceptible to the viruses. With seasonal flu we make an informed decision  about fever  reducing meds against the benefits and relief they can bring. With Covid19 would fever reducing meds be correct, considering the fever is battling the virus? Isn't turning off this defence a grave mistake? Hi, I am new to medical science, due to the outbreak of a virus that has many fearing and to some extent locked down.  So i am seeking medical information on the virus. I have the following questions in regards to the Sars Cov2 . 1. Is Sars Cov2 a retrovirus ? 2. What process is generally followed when medical scientist want to find the cause of a group of people becoming sick and this spreading as in Covid 19. 3. The Sars Cov2 virus is said to be a new corona virus. what characteristics must a virus have to be qualified a new type of virus pertaining to an existing virus group. 4. There are different pictures of the Sars Cov2 virus on the internet. I have attaches 3 pictures of Sars Cov2 from 3 different sources. New England medical journal, an article in Newyork Posst, www. scientificanimations.com Can you give some feedback if the virus in this pictures can be said to be the same virus. 5. In order to say that there is an epidemic, should the characteristics of the virus found in america be equal to that found in China, and other places ? Kind regards The human body is NOT an autoclave. Its my understanding that fevers are generally a metabolic side effect of both high immune system and viral activity and that fever is NOT a direct defense measure for any infection. Not to overgeneralize but I suspect most virus have wider temperature tolerances than the human body can endure without severe, even potentially fatal impacts. You will likely have to depend on anti-bodies like anyone else. Though I do think heard that the Chinese did try heating and cool that during that artificial blood treatment too.  However, its worth noting that even if successful in cleaning the blood of COV-19, the rest of the body's cells would still harbor COV-19 virus and those cells outnumber blood cells leading to rapid reinfection of the blood.  More correctly a certain percentage of the body cells would currently be COV-19 infected with no reason to think the percentage is different than the general body cells prior to cleansing. Cleansing blood by temperature or substitute might give a small anti-viral fight boost -- but only as the proportion of blood cell weight to body cell weight. Still it would be interesting to know at what temperatures COV-19 begins to slow down and then when it begins to break down. Probably at least 130F if we want to overgeneralize  from cooking proteins in rare meat or lowest recommended autoclave settings for general use. Hi, I was wondering about 1. the effectiveness of social distancing with examples and also 2. What to do if you actually contract coronavirus Yes thank you.  This is one concerning long range plans to deal with Corona Viruses in general.  We have that I know of three attacks on the human population by Corona type viruses SARS, MERS and now COVID19.  It is my understanding that these are generally viruses that are found in other mammals and they are deadly because when they mutate to affect humans we have no natural immunity built up to them that we would with other diseases that have been affecting us for some time such as the common flu. That being said when we are looking at treatments and vaccines for this virus is there some similar factors in all Corona viruses which would assist us to be able to create treatments for the next Corona virus that makes the leap from another animal or a bird.  Theoretically they should be equally more lethal as we don't have immunities to these viruses because we have never been affected by them before.  However that does not mean that treatments which affect Corona or SARS or MERS cannot be adapted to  new type of Corona virus in the future.    Also if we can get a vaccine to one type of Corona virus, even if it is not going to stop infection from its cousins, would the immunity given by that virus assist us going forward against them to at least reduce the overall lethality. If either of these questions are possibly true then would it not make sense to start cataloguing the various types of corona in other birds and mammals that exist and studying their properties and how to treat them in the normal host.  Let us assume that there is a Corona virus that affects say goats.  If we study how it affects goats and how to immunize goats against it and treat goats that catch it then if that virus would mutate and jump to humans would not that information be very helpful. Maybe there are plans to already do this,  I am a laymen so I don't know.  Just seems to me there are things we can do to prevent the next one because this virus in many forms appears to want to live in humans too now for some reason. The number of cases reported are for confirmed cases. Is there a published number of likely actual cases? Here is my estimation method. If one observes the death total for a given day, then assume that those people probably contracted the virus 14-21 days prior, one could  additionally assume that the inverse of the deaths rate number of infections produced that total of dead. If we use that hypothesis, a WHO expected deaths rate of 3.6%,  a 22 Mar total dead of 413, one calculates that 11,422 infections generated those deaths. If we look back 14 days from 22 Mar, we find 106 new cases were identified. That is an undercounting of cases by a factor of  ~100. Assuming that same undercounting in still occurring, we have 1,000,000 new cases every day. Choosing a lower death rate or longer average time to death only makes the numbers worse. Feel free to dissect my method. Is recurrent exposure, either during recovery or during sickness, an issue affecting recovery outcomes?  I'm asking because of reports that young adults in their 20s are being seen in hospitals, and because of the report of a 29 yo Chinese doctor that died. My thoughts are that recurring exposure, even if one's immune system seems to have developed antibodies, can bombard the lungs with this aerosolized virus in such a way that the immune system can't keep up. If this is true, then those recovering, including those sick, should be isolated and not put into a big room with others that are sick.  Breathing contaminated air gives a direct route for the virus to get to the infected area - the lungs. Is this  virus which may be not doing anything now in a higher immunity body (asymptomatic), but will do mutation to make it self stronger day by day .. once it gets the next body , will again start the same .. For example 1-10 person numbered as per increasing immunity .. Then this virus will do mutation wrt immunity ... If it returns from 10th no person to 1st or 2nd .. that earlier asymptomatic person/mild symptom to be getting severe stage Do I answer a question about why- children do not have coronavirus?   Answer -Blood pH *   Please identified  Identify the  graph (pH - age) . it seems that the virus does not resist the blood that has a high alkalinity Hi, I believe I’ve been infected, but teledoc told me I wouldn’t be tested due to not being in contact with a “confirmed case” and my age, which is frustrating. I’m starting to feel a little better now, and my older parents want me to go visit them once I recover. Does anyone have any idea how long we’re ACTUALLY contagious with this virus? This seems to be a big question since there are so many people not getting tested and we’re trying to limit the spread... Do we know of any promising data from ppl who had the Prevnar 13  pneumonia vaccine having a lighter load?  or easier bought? I think Doctors in America knew about this virus as early as Dec 2019. After 2 weeks of no energy dad is rushed to hospital. He almost never came back home. Drowning in his own puss. 2 months until hes home. Week after dad gone mom gets sick.

Almost drowned in his own puss. Copd. and 71 years old. Doc have no idea what got him sick. Week after dad left mom gets sick. In bed 5 days. 6 weeks until she felt ok. Fever, dry cough, exhausted, she was scared she was dying, couldn't get enough air, chills, body hurt, lower back pain, sore throat, and very bad pink eye that cleared up when she got better.  Diabetic type 2 and 70 years. Week after mom was sick I got sick. Scratchy throat, dry cough but did cough up globs of stuff first few days. Then as hard as I tried nothing more would come up but the pressure on my chest was so heavy, Most of the time I tried not to cough cuz it left me gasping for air. Had no energy at all. I was in bed 2 days. Took me 4 weeks to feel normal. Smoker 46 years old. I came down sick Christmas eve 2019. Dad in hospital fighting for his life. He got sick beginning of Dec. Trying to figure out what virus my dad got which to this day they never figured it out they asked him a question. You get any packages from China at your house. My dad said why yes. About 50 package each day from China, Hong Kong and India.  My dad told me this I though he was just being paranoid.  End of Jan 2020 China breaks out in an Explosion of a deadly virus. My question the world learned of Sars 2 end of January. Why did the Doctor ask about mail coming from China? At this point there are no viruses that could survive that trip. Then comes the Corona and its particles were still found on the ship 17 days later.  Hes not my doctor I cant ask him. My dads to tired doesnt want to think about it any more. By the way we live in California. My state is exploding in corona. We've been in lockdown for 2 weeks.    I want to be tested for antibodies before they go back to sleep cuz I want to know if Im immune.  I am not happy about that question the Doc asked. Thank you Could someone please tell me if Coronavirus is considered an influenza? Thank you. Hello everyone! Here is a line of thought that might be fun to think about. Mongolian bat migration routes from November 2019 - January 2020. Mongolian bat fleas and raw dead bat meat. Where they are captured and sold for consumption. Yersinia pestis and Sars-CoV. The news article indicating 2 deaths from November 2019 and viral mutation. Could all of this be correlative? I was thinking about the spread and the current affected humans of this virus. The spots that are most afflicted seem to be post-Mesopotamian cultures and countries probably with the highest percentage of the 4000 bc nomadic tribes that migrated west while burying the dead that had pestis. I am no scientist but an avid international reader of news articles. I spend about 10 hours every day consuming journalistic information. I do not think this is correlative per say but I know that Mongolian history of pestis strains and their respective spread throughout history could be an interesting field of study considering the current hysteria. It could be interesting to me to understand where and what mammalian/avian species came from. I don't really have a question though just a general topic of interest here. So far, there is no proof that the COVID-19 strain is becoming more deadly as it adapts. The end discussion of the 13 page document indicates this. Don't know if it is peer reviewed though. I don't have a background in biology and have some simple questions, I need the information for my research. 1) Does covid2 exist as a cell? 2) What is the size of this cell or in whichever shape it exists 3) In order to visualize it on the surface, do we need a light microscope or an electron microscope? 4) There are several pictures of it on the internet, how does it look like on the surface. For 4) This isn't an external virus. It doesn't have a proven visual tell. Just like any influenza We have a 24 hour update in our country. As long as you make sure to be careful around your aging population, the spread should not be as deadly but it will happen regardless over time. I am a person who is 67 who have underlying rare condition Sarcoidosis which affects the lungs.   I remember being treated with old standby medication plaquenil for my condition in the past.  It took a while, but was successful.  Although my Sarcoidosis is no comparison to this deadly virus. I would like to know is  there some light in the tunnel that hydroxychloroquine  with combination of other agents may just be a temporary answer until a vaccine is available? I have been reviewing my recent medical history and, in light of new theories about the coronavirus (see enclosed article) I am thinking that it is very possible that I had contracted it back in January prior to testing. I am now wondering if I could be tested to see if that is the case. It would be very helpful for me to know if I am immune so that my life could be less restricted ….. very difficult at my age as I am still blessed with an active lifestyle. It might also help the scientific studies that are being done to track the spread and better understand the symptoms of the disease. Here is the history to which I am referring: From December 28 through January 4 a couple from Venice were staying at my apartment with me. On January 21 I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night feeling very ill….nauseous, sweaty, dizzy, weak. I tried to get up and almost fainted. Thinking I might be having a heart attack, I called 911 and was taken to NYU Hospital by ambulance. I spent the night there undergoing various tests and, although they could not determine the cause of the symptoms, I was told that it was not a heart attack. They indicated that it might be some kind of virus. I was sent home and immediately began to experience severe diarrhea which lasted about a week, in addition to the nausea, weakness and dizziness. I all of my 87 years I have never felt so sick. When I saw my doctor on January 27, as advised by the ER doctor, I was still wobbly. At that time, he did some additional tests (not sure what they were)….corona virus was not really on the radar yet. Can I be tested to see if I had the virus and am now immune? How would I arrange that?"

Here's why that rate is so high. My Uneducated guess is that it mutates and becomes stronger or IF IT IS MANMADE bioterrorism, maybe they unleashed a larger amount of the virus in Italy That's not very scientific. Who are 'they' and how did they unleash larger amounts of the virus in Italy? Were they basting hand rails with the virus? Is it not more feasible that the virus mutated on it's own like every other virus that humans pick up. Misinformation is manmade  ya big uneducated guesser. Why not blame the neighbor to the Northeast of China. Conspiracy theorist's  can claim it was in some of the test fired missiles to get the conspiracy theories going full force. Sure they are supposed to be allies but in reality who would come to the military aid of China? Since the missile firing nation denies any cases at all period and knowing the neighbor to the South is a Nato country with thousands of U.S. military present why not.Sounds like a good conspiracy theory to me. In reality it most likely will never be made clear where it really came from or how it started because of where it started since China loves to keep their inner problems as quiet as possible.Who know where we would be if not for the Chinese doctor who first blew the whistle and has now paid the price with his own death from the virus. Still in the USA our leaders continue to point fingers when they should stand together to attempt to stop the spread but politics overrides the health of the nation. This is not a very good article. It missed one of the obvious reasons why Italians have infected each other so quickly. Body contact! They are one of the cuddliest nations on the planet. Anyone who has hung out with them knows how touchy and feely they are, even old men walk down the street holding hands no matter their orientation. It's just friendship. They sit on the bus and lean all over each other with their arms around each other.  Then you have the hugging and kissing and large families hanging out with much physical love. The large aging population also has lots of aging friends so they are very social playing Bocci Ball (sorry if that is not spelled correctly) and chess and whatnot. The weather helps this happen although there would be similarities in Spain, but not to the same extent. It's hard to take any article seriously that hasn't noticed this massive societal difference in Italy which differentiates it to many European places. Please stop saying that these face masks are protective against covid 19! They're not and consumers are buying up all the masks that we desperately need in hospitals and dental practices. They only work for basic medical hygiene such as the dentist not accidentally spitting in someone's mouth and avoiding little snot pieces falling out of their nose onto people. The Italians have a very poor ; and people have to search far & wide for work.  This is from my best information. Unless things have much changed, and very recently. So there is this mass movement of rural folk in the country lanes and ruddy-necked men braving the world of the towns and cities for jobs, because there is very little Social-Security support. These people are ideal Covid19 vectors. Lisa...you do raise a good point in spite of being ""uneducated"" ... hopefully FEMA, NIH, and the CDC are noting how vulnerable we (all populations) are to bio-terrorism. Very likely some others are ""noting"". More deaths among older people, older population in Italy, possibly missing milder cases especially among younger people,  all possible reasons for higher death rate. From the data we have-10% death rate in older people, doubling time 3-6 days, 3-4 weeks from infection to death, there were ~3500 cases 3-4 weeks ago (when the people now dying were infected) which has doubled 3-9 times, so 8-500x  since then, so Italy now has 30,000-150,000 cases, vs 9000 known cases. And how do you know that? I'm not a scientist but isn't it obvious the way the Italians greet each other it's no wonder it's spread so fast Deaths aren't higher in Italy. They're not testing younger people with less severe disease. Both good and bad news. Edit: Twitter didn't unroll so here's the latest chart.  Italy isn't testing younger people with no or mild symptoms. Don't have any science on this but in the weeks leading up to Italy's infection rate there were quite a few Chinese tourists in Venice, Rome, etc. They love to travel to Italy and perhaps there was such a saturation of contagion there. I am confused by Italy because I put store in the notion that ACE2 genome/enzyme distribution might predict severity of the epidemic. Italy has the lowest prevalence of the genome in the European countries surveyed by the following research. in Table 2 Michael F. Holick, MD, PhD, Professor of Physiology and Biophysics, and leading authority on vitamin D, writes: ""Most children and adults are vitamin D deficient in the winter. Essentially no vitamin D can be made from sun exposure during the months of November through March if you live above or below 35 degrees latitude (e.g. Busan, S. Korea, Xi'an, China, Atlanta, USA or Malaga, Spain). It has been suggested that there is a seasonal stimulus for developing viral infections such as the flu during the winter time. At the time of the peak flu season in the winter is at exactly the same time a person's vitamin D status [blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D] is at its lowest level. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining a healthy immune system and therefore winter-associated vitamin D deficiency can weaken the immune system increasing the risk of developing viral infections that cause upper respiratory tract infections. There is evidence that adequate levels of vitamin D during the winter can result in a reduction in the incidence of influenza A and in other viral illnesses of the respiratory tract. Given the newness of the coronavirus (COVID-19), no research has studied how vitamin D levels might be associated with the incidence or severity of a coronavirus infection. However, at this time I believe it is prudent to make sure everyone has adequate vitamin D levels."" Ernest T. Armstrong, inventor of the vitamin D promoting sunscreen Solar D® ( ), writes: ""All countries worst hit by COVID-19 are northern, wintertime countries or countries where people get very little sunshine and therefore make very little vitamin D in their skin. If the COVID-19 acts similar to other known seasonal viruses, then in the spring as the sun climbs higher in the sky, people will make more vitamin D, immune-system suppression will lessen, and the number of new cases of COVID-19 will fall dramatically."" From what I have read, Italy's population has the oldest median age. For those unfamiliar with the term, is the that divides a population into two numerically equally sized groups - that is, half the people are younger than this and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the distribution of a population. 46 is the median age in Italy's case, which makes it one of the oldest, if not the oldest nation on earth. As the virus seems most effective on the older generation, Italy is suffering the most. Plus the fact they are a very tactile race. Question 1 - Which countries in Europe kiss most when greeting? Answer - Italy, Spain, France. Question 2 - Which countries had the most CV soonest? Answer -  ? Lots of Old People...Just short of 23% over 65...Think of Florida CLOVID-19 patients are infected with a zoonotic coronavirus that comes from an animal* that has a core body temperature 3 degrees C higher than humans.  The human body’s immune system, especially seniors**, can not produce a fever high enough to effectively fight this virus. * In fact ALL of human’s deadliest flus come from animals (pig, bird, bat, camel) with core body temperatures at least 3 degrees C higher than man. ** Seniors can have core body temperatures as low as 36C and their immune systems are sometimes not even capable of producing any type of a fever.  Children on the other hand have extremely effective immune systems and spike high fevers very easily. The reasons why the # of cases and # of deaths are so high in Italy are fourfold: #1 signed a memorandum of understanding with China to take part in its giant Belt and Road Initiative ( ) trade project.  Because of that, thousands of people from China were coming into Italy even after the threat of COVID-19 became known #2 As a result of #1 and not taking the threat seriously, they acted too late to stop all travel from China and close its borders. #3 A recent study found that 95% of the people in Italy who died had one or more underlying health issues that put them at high-risk of contracting the virus. This is also why the case count was so high. #4. Italy's government-run health care system is awful and a lot worse than in other countries with similar systems. Another significant contributing factor in addition to age and comorbidity is the fact that the air in Northern Italy is highly polluted and there is minimal wind because of the surrounding mountain ranges.  Air pollution appears to play a significant role.  A film to add another twist to the chaos - Unfortunately, the ""aging population"" theory doesn't hold when we look at Japan, which has the oldest population on earth. They've only had a small handful of cases by comparison to other countries on a percentage basis (as well as on a pure numbers basis). The bio-weapon theory also fails because there is no clear pattern regarding who could be the intended target. I haven't seen any evidence one way or the other about panic and fear rates, but I suspect this is at the root of the issue. Countries that have experienced greater panic and fear levels have had the worst of it. News reports out of Italy in particular in January and February showed very high paranoia levels. The Japanese, on the other hand, have been relatively calm about it. I suspect this is the governing factor where infection and death rates are concerned. High compared to what? Seasonal Flu epidemics cause more deaths in Italy than the current number of deaths attributed to the SARS-nCov2. e.g. ""We estimated excess deaths of 7,027, 20,259, 15,801 and 24,981 attributable to influenza epidemics in the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17, respectively"" Number of deaths is as expected in any flu season in Italy. Death Rate is an extremely unreliable quantity since the denominator is based on something we can never know for sure: The number of people infected who were not detected as having been infected. Mods: What happened to my other posts? Have they been deleted? Italy and Other Needs solutions China Death Rates falls off. I don’t understand why world is not sharing the information about the way of curing their patients Second This Covid-19 is a RNA Virus, as I read about its molecular structure and behavior it’s way of action is slow in the beginning but as it take over on ACE-2 the action stimulates and accelerate."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/the-case-for-herd-immunity.2341/,The case for herd immunity,"Let's take a look at our current strategy for fighting Covid 19.  We've decided we're going to fight this contagion by ""playing it safe.""  And inso doing, we can only assume that if any given state who has just relaxed its restrictions finds its cases increasing substantially (and who knows what that means, our leaders never bother telling us) then they will go back and clamp down on the current easing and presumably return to the same lockdowns that characterized the first month and a half or so of the outbreak with hopes of keeping the disease spread to a minimum until a vaccine or effective treatment can be developed. Sounds good, so what's the problem with playing it safe? 1.  Economic: You don't need an economist to tell you that by shutting down most of the economy, we're in for an economic crash not seen since, well, it takes us back beyond The Great Depression.  Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to go all the way back to the early part of the 1700s to find a collapse of comparable magnitude.   The implications of which are multifold.  Livelihoods and dreams in ruins:  countless businesses have and will continue to shut down, turning the carefully cultivated futures of literally millions of people to ashes.  Long-term unemployment for people living paycheck-to-paycheck resulting in bankruptcies of astounding magnitude, shaking the very foundations of our society. 2.  The psychological impact of isolation and loss of income:  The Washington Post just ran an article titled (and which requires no further explanation), ""The coronavirus pandemic is pushing America into a mental-health crisis.  Anxiety and depression are rising. The U.S. is ill-prepared, with some clinics already on the brink of collapse.""  ( ) And people forced to live with each other day in and day out is not a healthy situation.  How many domestic violence cases will occur?  How many relationships will end?  How many irretrievable words will be exchanged between otherwise well-coexisting people?  (Personally, if I had to live side-by-side with Jesus Christ for months on end, eventually I'm not so sure one of us wouldn't end up dead.) 3.  The unintended death toll:  Besides a rise in expected suicides, The International Food Policy Institute just estimated that the economic toll on the world's economy will double the 147 million people living in extreme poverty, likely resulting in millions of deaths through hunger.  ( ) With all of this in mind the otherwise sound advice of, ""Listen to your doctor,"" by in this case shutting down the economy, makes a physician's words seem myopic.  Doctors are not trained to think in these terms.  They aren't trained to see the big picture.  They see a sick patient and their number one concern is to make them healthy at whatever cost.   And our legal system only reinforces this by imposing staggering fines on any doctor that might have forgotten.  Unfortunately in all of this it's the Hippocratic Oath itself, ""do no harm,"" that is being forgotten. So what happens if we ""go reckless"" and remove restrictions on ourselves and our economies?  If instead of trying to keep the pandemic's spread to an absolute minimum, we allow most of us to get the disease?  A false argument currently exists that assumes we either shut down everything when under a pandemic's stress or we let 'er rip, best stated by a forestry official's famous quote while Yellowstone Park was in flames during the late 70s:  ""Burn baby, burn!""  Nobody seems to be talking about focusing on better protecting that small percentage of the population that runs a high risk of ending up in a hospital's care while allowing the rest of society to contract the disease, get over it, and get back to work.  While estimates vary as to how many people need to be infected and consequently become immune to the disease in order to stop it from spreading, 75% might seem a reasonable assumption.  At this point as you may already know, we reach what is referred to as, ""herd immunity,"" when enough people are immune to keep a disease from spreading.  But can we even handle an acceleration of infections? Hospital Supplies As far as hospital supplies are concerned, it's anybody's guess.  We hear about shortages of various hospital supplies, but other than usual anecdotal reports, researching it I was unable to get any idea of exactly what was needed when and where, nor do I doubt anybody can currently answer that question.  But I do believe it is not unreasonable to assume that hospital supplies like what one hospital in my state has requested: can't be compensated for by either simple improvisation (bullets 1, 2, 3, 5), making do with latex for those not allergic (6) and simply sterilizing what you have (which could apply to many of these.)  An N95 mask is nothing other than a basic cloth mask with a small filter fixed to the front that filters out 95 percent of particulate matter in the environment and which under normal conditions can be picked up at the hardware store.  Can't these masks be sanitized and the filter strips replaced?  I can't believe that in an emergency (like one with the potential for creating a scenario described above) that any of these shortages can't be made up for or accommodated by alternate means.  And if they are shortages, by how much and under what conditions?  I think this might be taking the adage, ""for lack of a nail, a war was lost,"" a little too far. This thinking may sound simplistic, but I find myself forced to answer the issue of shortages in such a way since none of these questions seem to be getting adequately addressed by anyone.   Other than the usual vague information our media and leaders get away with under normal circumstances, when the issues so profoundly effect our lives more than ever we deserve better, more complete answers to these questions provided to the best of their ability.  Instead, we're forced to guess our way around things or trust they have them under control.  (And we all know where that can lead us.)   And if the people who should know don't know, do we assume these possible shortages can't be dealt with while knowing what's about to hit us through prolonged quarantines? As for ventilators. it turns out that they were in all probability being over used to begin with resulting in more deaths since ventilation requires sedating the patent, which works to weaken them in other ways.  ( ) Hospital Facilities Despite what the news media depicts of a nationwide hospital system at the verge of collapse, with the exception of the densest urban area hospitals during the hight of the crisis, the vast majority of our hospitals are currently way under utilized.  How do we determine that for our particular state?  Since the total number of patients currently hospitalized in every state isn't always available, we can get a pretty good idea by totaling the number of confirmed cases in any state admitted over the last 10 days (being the average time spent in hospital for covid-19 patient) from the list provided here ( ) then dividing that by the average percent hospitalized.  Here in New Hampshire it's currently 11% where we are currently treating 107 patients.  ( ) In the meantime like in many states, New Hampshire has set up temporary emergency facilities, which alone totaled 1400 beds.  Knowing these beds would be used for covid-19 patients, presumably they are equipped with the necessary facilities to handle these kinds of cases.  If only these beds were counted as being usable to treat covid-19 patients, that would still allow for 140 hospital admissions per day (X 10 days average stay = accommodating 1400 patients at a time).  But this does not mean the state can only handle 1400 people sick with covid-19 at any given time, it is that many sick who require hospitalization.  And what is the true number of infections that represents?  Since we know that in New Hampshire 11% of those testing positive for covid-19 are admitted to a hospital, approximately 1300 would have tested positive with 140 of those being admitted. The current antibody tests can give us an idea of how many people are or have been infected with covid-19.  We would probably have more results to compare but the powers that be determined we are better off with no information than some information and so put a stop to quick release of results before extensive peer review takes place.  (Like they have all the time in the world and they haven't already used far less complete information to insist we abide by the most draconian resolutions.)  The most reported on result (and perhaps the most reliable) being New York State's recent study that found a conservative interpretation of the figure to be 10.7 times the number of confirmed infections to actually be infected.  ( ) Thirteen hundred cases per day testing positive would indicate that about 14,000 had actually been infected (1300 X 10.7).  So those 1400 temporary emergency hospital beds represent 140 potential patients testing positive and being admitted per day amongst the 1300 that tested positive, among the 14,000 who were actually infected per day.  So if these emergency facilities alone can handle the nursing requirements of 14,000 new total infections in New Hampshire per day, that would therefore accommodate about 420,000 per month (14,000 X 30 days) of the actual total number of infections.   The total population of New Hampshire is 1.3 million, meaning under the hypothetical condition that these emergency beds were the only ones available in the state, they could handle 75% saturation of infection amongst the population and allow us to reach herd immunity in as little as 70 days.  Of course the infection rate would be in the shape of a curve meaning it would be impossible to calibrate infections to stretch evenly over this time period; however, if we wanted to conclude the pandemic within anything near 70 days--unless you live in a densely packed city that hasn't already been hard-hit--the problem will probably be getting that many people infected that quickly, not keeping them from being infected.  If the system appears to be approaching strain, a temporary imposition of shut-downs and increased social distancing can be imposed depending on local conditions. Get Sick Now, Do It for Grandma All of those numbers on hospital capabilities assumes the percentage of hospital admissions to actual infections stays the same.  But if we were to opt for this quick ""in-and-out"" approach we could then ask for and provide extraordinary protective measures for the most vulnerable to hospitalization--knowing they would only be subject to its confines and the rest of us to its cost--for a limited period before herd immunity could be achieved amongst the general population.  Instead of the battle cry being, ""Stay home and keep Grandma from getting sick,"" it could instead be, ""Get sick, do it now, do it Grandma.""  In this way, the outbreak could be over and done with before the next flu season comes around (which could begin anytime from October on and which hospitalizes up to .25% of the population) making now the best time to get started before the hospitals start to fill up.  A strong argument might be made that this system would actually save lives and save the economy rather than take more lives.  Meanwhile the current ""safe"" drip . . . drip . . . drip method could end up costing more lives in the end than it saves through forcing the most vulnerable to live in a contagious environment for longer periods, through increased suicides and general shortening of lives through hardship, to out-and-out mass starvation amongst the world's very most vulnerable--and claiming these particular lives at a far younger age than could otherwise have been.  Couple that with a near guarantee of crippling the world's economy and the ""safe"" play starts looking like it deserves to be questioned. While it seems to be part of the human condition to resort to ""what ifs"" of forecasted eventualities in order to justify playing it safe, allow me to give you one scenario about maintaining our attempt to keep the population ""safe"" from contracting this virus.  What if ten years from now a new strain of coronavirus comes along that is far deadlier than this one and very few have the internal defenses capable of identifying it, and then combatting it?  But if ten years from now it comes to pass and we've already had its ilk, those mostly elderly who are the most vulnerable today will in all likelihood have passed on and those who will be amongst the new vulnerable of tomorrow will at least have already had a similar virus.  Perhaps it will be dealing with the devil we know today that will keep us alive tomorrow. A brilliantly written summary. Here in NZ it seems robust debate is simply not tolerated. So instead of a balanced approach allowing small business to survive and social mixing to continue, and life to continue, we too have been locked down. The result will be a winter of discontent and all of the horrors you have referred to above. I am 62 and very happy to ""let it go"".  As you have stated, if a truly lethal pandemic hits, the likes of smallpox, the cupboard will be bare. I found the best source for state-by-state information is at: (Reliable?  I don't know... but I think it's what JHU uses) Unfortunately, not all states report all information, so that makes things a little bit difficult. For New Hampshire: You can calculate the active cases by taking the positive number of cases and subtracting recovered and subtracting deaths.  For New Hampshire (at the time of this post) the active cases were 1798 and the number actively hospitalized is 113 or 6.2% of all the active cases in New Hampshire. If you actually take a look at all of the data - but you can only include states that report recovered cases, otherwise your number of active cases is going to be substantially wrong.  The average hospitalization rate in the US (for states that report hospitalizations) is 4.5% with states averaging 780 active hospitalizations - that seems a little high. Remove New York and New Jersey from this model and your average active number of hospitalizations goes down to 472 - which might be a little high, but reasonable.  But this makes your average hospitalization rate 7.1% but still probably reasonable.  This would seem to indicate that New Hampshire is in a decent enough spot in this pandemic not to be too fearful. Probably a better telling stat would be, just how much hospital capacity does New Hampshire have?  I'm assuming the state has more than 113 hospital beds, so those 113 Covid-19 patients aren't consuming all of their hospital capacity.  Additionally knowing how many ICU cases are in New Hampshire (they don't report that) and the overall ICU capacity for New Hampshire might be an even better stat. And as you say, the hospitalizations are more than likely in large urban areas.  New York state has 7,226 hospitalizations and 257,052 active cases.  How much of those are in Upstate New York and how many are in the New York City area?  I'd say a large portion of those are in NYC - but I'm just guessing.  But it also underscores where all of this divided up information could be more beneficial if we were able to look at it in terms of US Congressional Districts - which I believe would show that the more rural areas are hardly affected by any of this."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/people-are-dying-of-covid-pneumonia-because-of-lung-temperature.2275/,People Are Dying Of COVID PNEUMONIA Because Of Lung Temperature,"ALL the “Experts” have stated that the “novel” coronavirus is unequivocally New and nobody can possibly have antibodies to protect against it. IF that is the case then there Has to be Something Other Than Antibodies that is stopping it, because 80% of the people getting infected are Not getting COVID Pneumonia.  So Why are they spending 100% of their efforts developing a “vaccine” that Only Works with antibodies when 80% of the population already has “Something Else” that works against the disease. So what is this “something else”?  WHY aren’t the Experts researching what has been “working” for 80% of those infected.  What about the one thing COVID Pneumonia Patients have in common? The the people getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 pneumonia Are either sedentary seniors with already very low core body temperatures Or people that are constantly being exposed to colder outdoor seasonal temperatures long enough to reduce lower respiratory tract temperatures to that of seniors.  The seasonality of colds and flu for most of us in higher latitudes is most acute in spring and fall because those are the seasons we push to be out side with warm cloths on to keep warm But Without Thought as to the cold air we breath into our respiratory tracts and how much we lower our lung temperatures.   Quite simply if it is cold enough outside to wear a jacket it is cold enough to affect your lung temperature. Viruses that cause respiratory infections are Limited to the respiratory tract for one reason and one reason only, it is the only internal  part of the human body that is constantly below our core body temperature of 37C.  All Human Respiratory viruses only replicate optimally at temperatures below 34C.  The Whole reason they are seasonal is because of seasonal temperature swings of the air we breath.  The novel coronavirus is especially deadly because it is zoonotic and come from an animal with a core body temperature of 40C and can replicate at higher temperature than human derived viruses but its replication is still limited by a body core temperature of 37C. Sedentary Seniors have core body temperatures of 35C to 36C simply because of low metabolic rates.  They are the hardest hit because there is nothing stopping the novel coronavirus from runaway replication in their colder lungs which can rapidly overwhelm them and cause lethal pneumonia.  Their ability to produce a fever is very slight and it seems Institutions these days are reluctant to turn up the heat for environmental reasons.  Seniors’ survival rates are very low because there has not been any effective treatment available for them. Next, those People that are continually exposed to seasonal moderately cold air temperatures that live, commute and work outside for extended periods of time long enough to lower their lung temperatures enough to allow the coronavirus to rapidly replicate in their lower respiratory tracts.  Coastal environments and cultural lifestyles all encourage their people into conditions that will lower their respiratory tract temperatures.  A new group of workers working in refrigerated environments like the meat industry are also emerging as being extremely vulnerable to “cold lungs” with COVID pneumonia rates almost as high as seniors care homes. And Finally, we have those People that are unfortunately infected and unwittingly taking fever reducing medications that are actually suppressing our body’s only initial immune defences And reducing the body’s ability to warm up their lungs.  And the final nail in the proverbial coffin however Is only partially heated ventilators that are delivering air/oxygen mixtures directly to patient lungs Below 37C degrees and further cooling the lungs and Promoting virus replication.  That is why survival rates on ventilators is so low, they are actually cooling the lungs. It is time to stop looking at infection numbers and start looking at mortality numbers, just who is getting the sickest and who is dying.  Yes there are exceptions, but the overwhelming majority of people with COVID pneumonia have One very obvious thing in common, Cold Lungs.  So what can be done, first off turn up the damn thermostats in Seniors Care Facilities and at least give them a fighting chance.  Daily Hyperthermic Treatments might also reduce the severity of the disease.  Outdoor and refrigeration exposed workers should be taking extra precautions to keep their respiratory tract temperatures warmer and exposure times less.  Infected patients should stop taking fever reducing medications unless absolutely necessary and for God’s Sake turn up the temperature on the ventilators. ALL the “Experts” have been so focused  on immunity and antibodies and vaccines that they have overlooked the obvious, IF the temperature within the respiratory tract is high enough, the Novel Coronavirus Can Not Replicate and Therefore Can Not Cause COVID-19. I don't think there are any ""experts"" in this business. They don't even try to find out why there are 1000 times more infections in the USA and a million times more deaths than a poor country like Vietnam.  In fact, all the developed countries have 100 to 1000 times more infections than all underdeveloped countries. They are guessing at the reasons but not trying to find out why. I believe the infections are due to recirculated air in closed buildings in the comfort of HVAC and totally ignoring this root cause in spite of several research papers suggesting viruses can be spread by HVAC. New York has the highest concentration of high rise buildings and people are falling like flies. The only people dying are those that get COVID pneumonia in the lungs and the universal common factor is a cold respiratory tract in them ALL.   Sedentary Seniors with low body core temperatures and then those that live, commute and work in cold outdoor spring air temperatures for long periods of time, just like Wuhan, Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium, France and New York.  How about the meat packing industry with people working in refrigerated conditions, cases are through the roof.  80% mortality for patients on ventilators getting cool air directly into their lungs.  Then take a look at who is NOT getting the pneumonia, kids with high BMRs and the ability to produce quick fevers, indoor workers that stay warm, poor people who live in crowded conditions but in warmer climates (India with 1.3 billion people and hardly any deaths), California (100,000 on crowded beaches and the hospitals are empty).  The common factor is inspired air  temperature! Because it is not for sure that the ones that had it could get it again and if no vaccine the virus would kill almost 800 million lives in the world or more, so we must kill this completely The jumble up within the host cell and mix and match their little pieces of genetic material a new, dramatically strain. 2. A infects your body by entering healthy cells. There, the invader makes copies of itself and multiplies throughout your body. latches its spiky surface proteins to receptors on healthy cells, especially those in your lungs. Specifically, the viral proteins bust into cells through ACE2 receptors. Once inside, the coronavirus hijacks healthy cells and takes command. Eventually, it kills some of the healthy cells. Not just the lungs I am over 60 my families history goes back many years and i will tell you it depends on the  individual so do not put  old people in any position why the cause of death, everyone in my family living today is over 80 and still alive not sick no nursing home. different cultures live longer because of the diet ,smoking , pollution, many things go into play here —In 2017, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.6 years, decreasing from 78.7 in 2016. Between 2016 and 2017, life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for males (76.2 to 76.1) and did not change for females (81.1). Life expectancy at birth decreased by 0.1 year for the white population (78.9 to 78.8) and the non-Hispanic white population (78.6 to 78.5) between 2016 and 2017. Life expectancy at birth did not change from 2016 for the black population (75.3), the non-Hispanic black population (74.9), and  Nobody’s risk is zero when it comes to To be clear, nobody should feel invulnerable to the coronavirus. Young people are going to contract the disease, a not-insignificant percentage of them are going to get very sick, and a smaller number will die. The rates of severe and deadly cases might not be nearly as high as the older generations that we are worried about, but the data already show that age alone does not make you invincible. Are life expectation is lower then 80 so when they talk about over 80 it is a very low percentage of 7.8 billion people on earth. However, evidence to date suggests that two groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years. It's important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable. WE really do not know very much about this virus information is great some is very miss leading depends of the interpretation of the individual. ""If you had mild respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 and were staying at home so as not to infect people, extend your quarantine for another two weeks after recovery to ensure that you don't infect other people,"" recommended corresponding author Lixin Xie, MD, professor, College of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing. The authors had a special message for the medical community: ""COVID-19 patients can be infectious even after their symptomatic recovery, so treat the asymptomatic/recently recovered patients as carefully as symptomatic patients."" The researchers emphasized that all of these patients had milder infections and recovered from the disease, and that the study looked at a small number of patients. They noted that it is unclear whether similar results would hold true for more vulnerable patients such as the elderly, those with suppressed immune systems and patients on immunosuppressive therapies. ""Further studies are needed to investigate if the real-time PCR-detected virus is capable of transmission in the later stages of COVID-19 infection,"" Dr. Xie added. Researchers have long known that the most frequent cause of the common cold, the rhinovirus, replicates more readily in the slightly cooler environment of the nasal cavity than in the warmer lungs. However, the focus of prior studies has been on how body temperature influenced the virus as opposed to the immune system, said study senior author and Yale professor of immunobiology Akiko Iwasaki. To investigate the relationship between temperature and immune response, Iwasaki and an interdisciplinary team of Yale researchers spearheaded by Ellen Foxman, a postdoctoral fellow in Iwasaki's lab, examined the cells taken from the airways of mice. They compared the immune response to rhinovirus when cells were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius, or core body temperature, and at the cooler 33 degrees Celsius. ""We found that the innate immune response to the rhinovirus is impaired at the lower body temperature compared to the core body temperature,"" Iwasaki said. The virus does not only live in the lungs , you speak so much of temp, well i live in Montana and we have less counts than the rest of the USA so does this cold weather work better or the heat in the desert And last thing can the virus really live outside the body if so why all the cleaning of the subway cars and buses and public areas , does it really in any temp , THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THIS CAN DO First off the virus is strictly a protein and is NOT alive until it affects one of your cells and starts to replicate using your live cell.  The key here is optimal replication temperature in which the virus replicated best at, however there is an upper temperature limit at which the virus can no longer replicate or stops multiplying.  For the rhinovirus that is 33C, this explains why the rhinovirus can not cause pneumonia, it can not replicate at lung temperatures.  As for the COVID virus I believe it can not replicate at temperatures above 36C.  If you really read my post above that is why I believe ONLY those people who have lung temperatures below 37C actually can get COVID PNEUMONIA.  All those above may get sick but will never develop pneumonia and die.  To understand this you have to realize your respiratory tract actually has a significant temperature gradient from your nose to your lungs.  Sedentary   Seniors actually start out at core body temperatures of 35C to 36C strictly because of low metabolic rates, that is why they are so susceptible to the virus, children on the other hand have very high metabolic rates and much higher core temperatures PLUS the ability to produce fevers very quickly, quite simply the COVID coronavirus can not replicate in the lungs of a child because they are too warm.  Non seniors that are dying are those that expose their lungs to cold air for long enough  periods to lower lung temperatures enough to allow the virus to replicate, again read the post above. This article is well-nourished on common sense, I´ll translate it to Spanish and spread it a bit on my country, we don't have this kind of forums and we have plenty of questions regarding this subjet I'm not a scientist so I don't completely understand the above.

HI! you mean you would like to wash your nose? that is useful, but try not to inhale it into your throat. I think blowing your nose is better I don't think so inhaling a spray of dilute soap water can help. If the virus is inside your body than soap water can't do anything."

"" I'm not a doctor but it seems common sense would tell you that.  I've often wondered why they rush in to give patients on ventilators drugs that supposedly have worked miracles in stopping COVID-19.  Why did they wait for the patient to get to such a critical state? I think that everyone is simply waiting for more information, and people are respectfully avoiding hospitals unless their symptoms are severe.  The knowledge is building rapidly, as is sharing the knowledge.  Testing, on the other hand, still lags badly behind the needs of our populace at large. I read this article with some hope - even though it relies on testing for a positive, it is a worthy effort with a safe drug. It will of course take some time to glean results and compare them to the average, but there's no way to speed this up.: I also see that there are recommendations (from actual medical professionals) to use an oximeter at home to monitor blood oxygen levels. Apparently the pneumonias associated with Covid-19 can be as insidious as the illness itself, and by the time it becomes severe enough to seek medical help it may be too late. In other words, people do not know how sick they really are. It's something I should be doing anyway because I have (low grade) asthma that is sharply aggravated by regular flu, so I finally ordered one.  They are remarkably inexpensive ($25-65 depending on brand and source), although finding one in stock is a bit of a challenge, as with many home medical supplies. Patients treated with remdesivir took an average of 11 days to recover as compared with 15 days for those who received a placebo, he said. ""Although a 31% improvement doesn't seem like a knockout 100%, it is a very important proof of concept,"" Fauci said. ""What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus."" You have to ask, why is Dr Fauci so enamored with this very expensive, not all that effective drug when hydroxychloroquine used with zinc is being used very successfully around the world and it's much more effective than remdesivir. Oops, they're talking about treatment. If we're going to discuss drugs, we should also be able to talk about herbs, vitamins and other options that can support the body's defenses."

The wave causing physicality is around 0.3 micrometers in wavelength. It is on the EM spectrum, but I don’t know if we can cause destructive interference without the aid of a black hole. That is where the decoherence wave is coming from. This would be the biggest breakthrough in science ..ever. Perhaps a coherent ultraviolet wave would do the trick. It would need set to the exact wavelength of the quantum/classical boundary. We know viruses are on the upper edge of this boundary because they do not display fringes in the double slit experiment. Viruses are a little larger than 0.3 micrometers. It takes light a femtosecond to cross this distance, so we are close to the frequency and wavelength necessary to cancel the decoherence wave out. If coherent waves don’t do it, we may need to figure out how to redirect other decoherence waves at the virus. We would find the exact resonant frequency at some stage of the virus that is unique. The resonant is only to locate the objects that need the decoherence wave canceled out. We can disassemble the virus while it is in matter wave form. The goal is to make it a pile of unbonded atoms. If swapping it to matter waves doesn't automatically do it, we will need to find the second punch to accomplish it. The resonant frequency might be enough to shake it apart. Keep in mind that duality at the same moment in time is not a thing that happens. Measuring a particle after its flight is not going to influence what the state was while in flight. Results depicting wave behavior, in this manner, does not determine a particle was in a duality. Can we detect EM waves with amplitude larger than the Earth? Amplitude is the DISTANCE between origin and crest (or trough) There should be an ultraviolet wave we never noticed before. The amplitude will be much larger than the earth, but have a wavelength of 0.3 micrometers. It repeats every femtosecond. This wave is originating from our black hole. It is the reason we have a quantum/classical boundary. There might be a window between femtoseconds. That 0.3 wave is what allows quantum behavior in our bodies and photosynthesis. Has anyone ever questioned the odd wave shapes in a bifurcation diagram? This couldn’t be some kind of map for the EM field ..could it?"

She is angry that I am not just pushing this to the side and acting like I’ve not been exposed and could possibly have the virus. I have a very bad situation at home which involves a lot of mental abuse and blaming by a step parent on both ME and my mother. My mom is angry at me and is scared of the consequences she will receive as a result of my very THOUGHT OUT decision. All I am trying to do is protect the people around me and my mother is angry at me and calling me a horrible child who is inconsiderate when, in reality, this is the most considerate decision I have made in a long time. Am I wrong for doing this? That’s very understandable all you need to do is to go on quarantine for 14 Days."
