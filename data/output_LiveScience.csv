Wow, that's an incredibly Pollyanna view  of the situation. The only BSL-4 lab built in China, which is already facing accusations of facilitating bio-weapons research is ""accidentally"" at the same location of the novel coronavirus release/appearance? China needs to be put on a bio-weapons watch list and sanctioned.  I don't know how this simple math is escaping a majority of the press releases related to coronavirus. They knew this from the beginning, but the optics are rather bad. Lol. Do you need more than one? The USA from a G00gle search has thirteen but would all of them be utilised for studying the new virus? Should China look to increase their BSL-4 capacity I am sure the world would react in fear of weaponising etc.. It is quite a while since the article and comment, reactivated by Scruffins, but it looks like CHina have faired far better than most countries with their one facility, unless the aim of the post is of a differing nature. Consider what would happen if a human contagious entity were brought back to Earth in an extraterrestrial sample. The availability of BSL-4 capacity and research ability might be paramount to our species' survival.  Only fools or the mentally ill would deliberately develop an Earth virus into a bioweapon which  could eventually kill its creators. True statement but one does not cancel the other We have lots of mad people on Earth so I would not be surprised if this one was created by a mad person who knew all the risks. Sadly and frighteningly, additional information and data revealed in the past two years since the covid-19 pandemic appeared, indicates that the global pharmaceutical industry seems to have current ""Gain of Function"" on-going programs at sundry labs around the world.  Michael Crichton's riveting book ""The Andromeda Strain"" now has a prescience beyond ""space exploration"" science fiction. I hope things will recover soon"

As with any other illness, you can protect yourself if you follow some basic steps. Here’s how to keep yourself safe from the coronavirus: Every public restroom has this sign up for a reason. The point of washing your hands is to kill germs that you pick up from touching everyday surfaces. Viruses can live for a surprising amount of time on things like countertops, door handles and the like, but they can also be killed with soap and disinfectants containing alcohol. Whether you’re in a public place or the comfort of your own home, regularly wash your hands with soap and warm water. The best way to avoid getting sick is to avoid those who already are. Simple, right? Limiting your exposure means you’ll be less likely to be infected, so stay away from crowded public places. When you have to leave the house, keep at least three feet between you and others when possible, and cover your nose and mouth if you suspect you’re near someone who’s sick. These are the easiest places for a virus to enter your body, so don’t give it a free ride. After you’ve been in a public place, don’t touch your face unless you’ve washed your hands thoroughly. Even then, it’s best to avoid contact. Keeping in mind the virus is active on surfaces for 9 days and mortality rate is 3.4% (so we've been told) compared to .095 for type A and B influenza (2019-2020) and the .13 micron virus piggybacks on moisture/vapor particles over 2.5 microns: Low profile out of house/shopping: lime green or desert camo Neoprene RV mask with a supply of N100/N99 filters (although N95/P2.5 will do), full seal swim goggles/glasses (the ones that look like normal glasses/sunglasses, flesh colored latex gloves. In house: hand sanitizer for returning home and handling packages and mail deliveries.  Bleach cleaner for floors/countertops especially where packages/mail groceries have been brought inside.  Dispose of all grocery bags.  No-scent Lysol spray for incoming groceries.  Avoid fresh produce which cannot be easily sterilized (like lettuce). hi i m reza from Iran corona is very good because we rest with family in home There is no protection only acceptance that your symptoms are asymptomatic or mildy symptomatic to recovery. Wherever they are wet open markets the potential will be there, in places  the demand for bush meat has brought level 4 contagions of various types of hemorrhagic fevers in Africa & level 3 contagion China's Corona viruses. - - Wear a mask when around other people (but we have a shortage of masks!) - Wash your hands often, and don't touch your face - Take care of your general health: nutrition, sleep, exercise, stress management, etc. - Vitamin D3, Vitamin C, fish oil, probiotics, ginger root tea That is pretty right. We are powerless in this situation. What can we do? Stay home and wash hands.. thats a good question.. first thing we know symptoms, precuations and treatments 1. Self Care wash your hands drink plenty of water keep clean your body wear mask (if you are outside) wear gloves (if you are outside) how can we fight against covid-19 thats to easy because we know that we all have to busy life in normal days and we can't give so much time to our family and the best thing now a days environment is going to clean we will fight covid-19 in simple ways we should stay home dnt go outside until necessary if we have to go outside then we should go with our care lockdown is a best solution now because we dont have vaccine nd medicine so stay home and stay safe: In addition to what the OP mentioned you've got to wear a mask in public.  Any mask is better than none.  Looks like the west is finally realizing that the east was right all along about the positive effects of the usage of masks. Face masks are costly and currently hard to find but they are out there if you look hard enough.  Just be careful with price gouging.  Stay safe out there! I think most infections occur in closed spaces like grocery stores, airports,  fitness clubs etc.. The virus is in the air and gets in through your eyes or nose. I don't think masks are fully effective because your eyes are exposed and masks do not completely filter the virus. My logic is based on personal experience with other viruses. I am sensitive like a canary in a coal mine with respect to viruses. I usually pick up a virus during every airplane trip.  It probably explains why India has only 1% of the infection rate in the USA. There are very few grocery and department stores. Most shops are open-air stalls so there is less chance of picking up the virus from the air. So avoid supermarkets. Buy online and carefully wipe off the packages with disinfectant. I am a 68 year old retired dentist living in a rural area of the State of Washington. Maybe my experiences as a dentist might be of help to some. Let me start by saying though that I am as perplexed as some of the experts are as to how rapidly this virus has spread, at least in some situations. Dentists examine people's mouths. We do it with a mirror in one hand and an explorer in the other. As we examine a patients open mouth, we are about a foot away or even less, sometimes asking questions, with the patient answering. I have never worn a mask while examining a patient and I honestly can say that in 30 years I have never caught anything doing exams that way. If a patient had an obvious head cold, I would be careful not to breath much, but still even then I would usually not wear a mask. Also, I tend to catch head colds about once a year, but never from doing a patient exam. I never seem to get the flu. I do not know why. Years ago, while drilling inside of a patient's mouth, I used to never wear a mask either, but during the last 15 years or so I would wear a shield to protect against splatter from the drill etc. Prior to not using a shield, I would occasionally pick something up from working inside of a patient's mouth, but at the time the only thing that dentists were really concerned about was acquiring Hepatitis B, but you could only get the disease with direct blood to blood contact, not from a patient cough. Later Hepatitis C and Aids came along. But they were also virtually impossible to catch from saliva.  Anyway, maybe this will be a help to some of you. It seems to me that you will not get the disease if you have incidental close contact with an infected person unless they cough in your direction. Being in an enclosed area with an infected person over a period of time might be a different story. Although simple talking from an infected person could theoretically give you the disease, in my experience the chances are extremely unlikely. Catching the disease outdoors is virtually impossible in my opinion, especially if there is any kind of a breeze, which probably makes the beach one of the safest places of all, even without much social distancing. I only try to reduce the odds of getting the disease down to something acceptable for me, not entirely eliminating the possibility. I do not wear a mask in public, but I certainly do wash my hands a lot more. I think you may have higher than normal immunity or acquired immunity due to your profession. I have just the opposite experience. I am like a canary in a coal mine when it comes to catching a cold or flu from a person several feet away. I catch them at parties, restaurants, etc. even if I keep a considerable distance from people.  After an airplane flight, I usually come down with a cold or flu. Finally, I found a herbal immunity booster lozenge that claimed it can stop that and many reviews confirmed it. So far it looks like it is working 100% of the time. It seems to prevent the infection if I take it before the flight and if I catch one someplace it gets rid of it in no time. While I have not seen any medical recommendation for the use of vitamin D to help prevent or minimize the effects of COVID 19, there is a clear correlation between reduced levels of vitamin D and increased cases of illness from the flu. Getting more sunshine on your skin or taking vitamin D supplements could reduce the number or severity of COVID 19 cases. People spend too much time inside."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/long-covid.6212/,Long Covid.,"Found this article with links to further information of interest and wanted to share with you. ' The infection may also alter how people's organs function. This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seen , which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels after , and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fats . There are early signs of , but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body.' There are two options to minimize covid-19 and variants health risks. Get vaccinated and follow masking and distancing protocols, (even if fully vaccinated).  No one really knows when this nightmare will end and how. True, but unfortunately the content of the link refers to people that actually are suffering having caught COVID19, so vaccination and distancing is not an option for curing the long covid on the knowledge we have. Very concerning the after affects of a disease that people caught over 12 months ago in many cases. The article has excellent information on the long term covid-19 effects.  Thanks.  I agree that the long term effects of the covid-19 virus on some people can range from  debilitating to devastating.  Such appears to be based upon genes and/or pre-existing conditions.  To use a gambling term ""it's a crap shoot"" if one gets covid-19, (or similar diseases like Lyme  disease in the U.S. which is a personal on-going experience).  The only ""protection"" from covid-19's possible multiple effects  seems to be avoidance of exposure and break through via vaccination and/or isolation/masking.   Worrisome indeed. I wished I was able to locate the medical journal I read yesterday which covered numerous [under peer review] increases for blood clotting as well as other conditions... The following link gives a summary including 'Six months later, those who'd had COVID-19 were found to be at higher risk of new onset heart disease, diabetes, mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, substance use disorders, kidney disease ' although the research is in its early stages and as stated needs to completely rule out lifestyle changes rather than COVID direct. Are you [or anyone else] aware of a disease as easily transmissable that has future health issues as per these links? I reiterate I am not an expert and pretty much repeating what I have read whilst choosing the more convincing position if two cases are opposed to each other. MERS and SARS do have future implications, but these have typically been contained and not gone on to create case numbers for eligible studies. Meningitis and encephalitis share the cognitive problems and can persist after the disease is gone if the body is not ready to release fluid buildup.  Polio lasts a lifetime and of course hiv & other immunodeficient pathogens. Herpes keratitis can deform the eye with scar tissue and wreck night vision since the scar site has a prismatic effect on single-point light sources, flooding the eye. The increased risk of long term effects may stem from lung damage and an immediate change to sedentary behavior.  I'm right at the one-year mark and still can't run. As a level set: The Great Courses offers a course ""An Introduction to Infectious Diseases"";  it may be available through one's local library or it can be purchased.  Now consider that the covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to have biological and viral containment systems as a critical part of the world's space programs.  Today many people have lasting effects from what is considered the current mix of human diseases.  Perhaps the money earmarked for a new aircraft carrier might be better spent on medical research, disease effects remediation and those containment systems. - Covid is created artificially. A piece of the HIV chain is embedded in it. The British created it, and tried to use it against Russia (the Skripal case). The Skripals passed out 5 days after the meeting with Bashirov and Petrov. All the dances of the British with the roles of "" BEGINNER!!!"" they look idiotic, but everything falls into place if we assume that it was covid. Petrov and Basharov were quarantined together with all the passengers after their arrival. - The Americans used Covid viruses against China, who requested virus samples for themselves when they dealt with the Skripals. It's strange that the order for use seems to have been given by Tromp. Like a smart man. Although they could be secretly used by shitocrats. - According to the results of recent studies, those who have had covid, including after vaccination or after vaccination, even with asymptomatic manifestations, scars are formed not only in the lungs, but also in the cerebral cortex. Which leads to the stupefaction of people. Congratulations! After 2-3 generations, all people will be equal in intelligence with monkeys. - I wonder if monkeys are sick with coronavirus? I think many people in the world if they had the opportunity to would like to take that heinous covid structure  by its heinoius nasty little horns  & snap em permantly off then stamp on the ""ball"" theyre sticking out of & flatten it until its finally dead for good -i know i would At the time of writing this is 100% incorrect with no vaccination available to assist long Covid [the topic for this discussion]. The more research being undertaken, the more side-effects are being found even if people initially suffered only mild symptoms. Even a continued vaccination program is not going to prevent further cases and to date I have not found how effective current vaccines are at preventing long covid - All well and good serious illness is significantly reduced, but it is too early to know about long-term effects of covid on vaccinated, Hi I wasnt questioning anything said -just because someone has been vaccinated twice doesnt mean you wont get it -it means if  you do get it you wont get it as bad All I said was it d  be just great if people had  the opportunity  -to be able to pick up that covid structure by its nasty little horns & snap them off permanently & when its devoid of them stamp on the ball that they stick out of until it dies for good No problem although I do not believe there is accepted evidence as yet about long-covid being less serious in double vaccinated people as opposed to non-vaccinated. One thing I am a million percent sure about - -if the world had an opportunity to take hold of all the covid variants in their hands tjey would wanna SNAP OFF THOSE HORNS & STAMP ON THE REST OF IT UNTIL IT DIES FOR GOOD!!! Its those horns on the covid structure that start off the infection - One other thing ive seen in the UK newspapers that the chinese people & their scientists  should be held to serious account  for letting covid escape their labs in Wuhan  only for it to come  all over other countries of the world to kill off innocent people Quite frankly I agree wholeheartedly -& had there been a petition to make them be held to account I for one wouldnt hesitiate to sign it Theyve caused a real serious worldwide pandemic -they started it off it started in China How dare China do this to the world - while the rest of the world suffer & die at the mercy of covid - the chinese are now a covid free country Please would you keep this thread discussion to Long Covid."

Apparently polypropylene sheets are charged via corona discharge treatment before manufacture into masks, filters etc. For most daily use the sheets that comprise the masks retain their charge due to their electret properties but lose this charge when being washed. This is especially the case when alcohol is being used as a disinfectant which is an intuitive go to disinfectant in medical environments. According to one study I read, this lose of static charge can lead up to 30% reduction in particle capture of the masks for 0.3 micron particles. For smaller particles in the range 0.1 microns (which is the size range of the Corona virus) and smaller the drop was less but still substantial. The interesting point is that these masks haven't mechanically degraded but rather simply have lost there endowed charge and would presumably be ""restored"" if ""recharged"". As I mentioned apparently the charge is given to the material in manufacture by a corona discharge treatment. So this is my question since I am very much a layperson on materiel science, is it possible to simply restore charge to masks , filters etc in a simple manner? Various scenarios and solutions have come to my mind from simply rubbing the inner lining with relevant material like rabbit fur to impart charge. Another is using the negative output of  a Van de Graaff style generator to expose the mask to a negative static field. Another is using a modified negative ion generator (used in air purification) expose the mask to negative charged static charges. I think this question is important in the extension of n95 and similar filters in hospitals in light of drastically chronic shortage faced in the Corona pandemic. great question and topic, sorry I can't be of help but I hope you get an educated response from someone I just got some rabbit fir/ slippers I am going to rub them on my mask I hope it recharges the mask thanks for the tip The CDC and the WHO both said not to bother wearing masks before they changed their minds.  This is a ffact not conspiracy theory The polypropylene must be in molten state during the corona charging process.   The nonwoven polypropylene fibers are spun like cotton candy through a corona discharge field."

Speculation? yes but thoughts nevertheless. ?Very best wishes, Marj. Very thought provoking questions.  I'll venture a comment  how I think Evolution works with hosts and viruses.  If a host has a defense against a virus invasion, the virus fails to reproduce and doesn't mutate.  If the virus infects a host and rapidly kills that host, that virus' reproduction is limited and eventually stops due to a lack of hosts.  Viruses that infect a host mutate via reproduction and may develop to be able to surmount other host's defenses and thus reproduce and mutate further.  A vaccine boosts/jump starts a host's defenses and limits a virus' reproduction and mutation.  I'm using the Polio and Small Pox  diseases/vaccines as examples.  As for virus ""precursors""  I have no knowledge. What do you mean by 'host evolves' as you come across as believing X-Men is real. What you are describing is Panspermia... I have not read this link, but assume it gives some relevant info- There’s still a debate going on as to whether viruses are even It’s just a protein core that does nothing at all, can’t even reproduce itself, unless a living cell runs into it. Viruses scare me. A host can evolve a defense, (antibodies, poisons, sharp spines), against a virus, bacterial, or other species.  Right now there is a plethora of information on Sars-Cov-2 and it's variants on the internet news services.   So if one wants a scare along with the morning cup(s) of coffee, I suggest reading these daily updates.  Also, the standard general information biology text book would provide clarification on Evolution and genetic mutation. I am currently picturing humans dressed as hedgehogs to ward off COVID19 now Actually since the covid-19 pandemic began sundry female personalities have made it routine events to appear on the internet with fewer and fewer amounts of clothing.  Given that these bodacious  women started with skimpy bikinis, their quaint, but interesting proclivity has provided an early morning ""eye opener"" as well as relief from the dreary news about covid-19. I can only wish these curvaceous women well with their Evolutionary experiment for covid-19 protection. The continuous mutation of the CCP virus, with multiple variants circulating around the world, could be described as the “next pandemic,” a top Taiwanese health official has warned. Wu Chung-hsiun, President of Taiwan’s Development Center for Biotechnology (DCB) and Director of the Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Industries Promotion Office of Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA told The Epoch Times he thought it was too early to predict the end of the COVID-19 pandemic “because this [virus]…keeps mutating and is still infecting people around the world.” It is also likely we will get immunity Antibody studies almost certainly underestimate natural immunity. Antibody testing doesn’t capture antigen-specific T-cells, which develop “memory” once they are activated by the virus. Survivors of the 1918 Spanish flu were found in 2008—90 years later—to have memory cells still able to produce neutralizing antibodies. Researchers at Sweden’s found that the percentage of people mounting a T-cell response after mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 infection consistently exceeded the percentage with detectable antibodies. T-cell immunity was even present in people who were exposed to infected family members but never developed symptoms. in September pointed out that the medical community may be under-appreciating the prevalence of immunity from activated T-cells. Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. would also suggest much broader immunity than recognized. About 1 in 600 Americans has died of Covid-19, which translates to a population fatality rate of about 0.15%. The Covid-19 infection fatality rate is about 0.23%. These numbers indicate that roughly two-thirds of the U.S. population has had the infection. In my own conversations with medical experts, I have noticed that they too often dismiss natural immunity, arguing that we don’t have data. The data certainly doesn’t fit the classic randomized-controlled-trial model of the old-guard medical establishment. There’s no control group. But the observational data is compelling. I have argued for months that we could save more American lives if those with prior Covid-19 infection forgo vaccines until all vulnerable seniors get their first dose. Several studies demonstrate that natural immunity should protect those who had Covid-19 until more vaccines are available. Half my friends in the medical community told me: Good idea. The other half said there isn’t enough data on natural immunity, despite the fact that reinfections have occurred in —and when they do occur, the cases are mild. In a modern democratic country I would very much doubt a population would accept this idea with the organisation to accurately roll out being impossible. In the USA, all it would take is one false negative preventing a vaccine and that person;s subsequent death to have a disaster of a lawsuit. You would also create a situation where people would resist random tests for fear of losing the possibility of a vaccine. I'm going to speculate that every country at the top of that list is underreporting. You don't get there by having good government practices. Viral evolution refers to the heritable genetic changes that a virus accumulates during its life time, which can arise from adaptations in response to environmental changes or the immune response of the host. Because of their short generation times and large population sizes, viruses can evolve rapidly. Thank you Marj x"

And now as booster jabs are approaching I have another question   -    If the 2 jabs have left a heightened risk of blood clots with me for life - do booster shots further heighten that  risk and accumulate so that after 4 , 5  or 10 boosters - death becomes imminent - Noody seems to understand the question let alone answer it ? It's easier to get blood clots from viral infections themselves, not vaccines, and the time frame for increased VITT risk from J&J and AstraZeneca is less than 28 days, according to the University of Michigan health. The mRNA vaccines Moderna and Pfizer have been shown to also have this risk, but incredibly reduced. Consideration for a VITT diagnosis should ruled out after 42 days according to the American Society of Hematology. I sure hope the medical experts can use google, or our healthcare system has another thing coming. Thanks. Do these 28 and 42 day limits mean that all those prone to clots would have had them by then and that those not prone have escaped by virtue of their constitution. And have those more resilient people  ( whilst remaining  clot free) - still walking around with elevated clotting potential. In short were the clot risk  stats of 28 / 40 days supported by blood test being taken or by a ""Those left standing"" assessment . Thanks for your time"

With earlier Wuhan Covid-19 data samples from December 2019 a better genetic picture could be created to help with vaccine development etc. Also keep in mind that the Thai bat coronavirus RacCS203 was not in a lab prior to Covid-19 starting that the Chinese viruses were all in labs that RaTG13 was only ever found once in one bat fecal swab sample in 2013 which now no longer exists that there are suggestions, yet to be disproved by the release of existing medical data and tests from 2012 and 2020, (both confirmed by Prof Shi), that some Mojiang Miners were infected and killed in 2012 by the virus RaTG12. it has been confirmed the Mojiang Miners became infected in the cave where RaTG13 was later found that Prof Shi in Nov 2020 confirmed her knowledge A. that the Mojiang Miners died of a virus and that this knowledge goes back to 2012/13, (which she more or less hid in Feb 2020) B. that Covid-19 tests were carried out in 2020 on the 2012 Mojiang Miners stored blood etc which she made no mention of being necessary or having been done in her Feb 2020 interviews Australian Covid-19 vaccine developer Professor Petrovsky ""I think that COVID-19 and its origins is one of those areas where unfortunately we have enormous amount of politics overlaid over the science. And so it gets harder to get to the truth in that context."" Prof Shi told the BBC that she is open to ""any kind of visit"" to rule out that the coronavirus leaked from her laboratory in Wuhan. However this still has not happened with the WHO investigators just talking to Prof Shi. According to the BBC Prof Shi won international acclaim for her discovery that the 2003 SARS outbreak, was caused by a virus that probably came from a species of bat in a Yunnan cave. The Daily Mail has quoted scientists as saying ""RacCS203 is thought to be unable to infect people as it can not bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells, Covid-19's gateway into the body. However, antibodies circulating in the blood of infected bats and pangolins were found to be effective at neutralising the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This biological paradox indicates bat-based coronaviruses can not, as standard, infect humans, experts speculate."" It has also been shown in lab tests and computer modelling that Covid-19 does not infect bat tissue. This leaves the probable alternatives that bat coronaviruses only evolve the ability to infect human cells after first being passed 1. into an intermediate host, such as a pangolin or 2. via gain of function or genetic manipulation lab research such as has been carried out by Prof Shi at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. No Covid-19 intermediate animal host or earlier virus has been found so far, despite China explaining to the WHO investigators that it has tested over 300 types of wild animals and 50,000 domesticated animals for Covid-19 The human gain of function lab processes can be done without any gene editing, by repeatedly mixing a virus with human tissue in lab dishes, or via live animals with a similar lung structure to humans, such as ferrets, so looking natural and leaving no obvious human intervention markers. Research should be done on both lab and natural origins in China and elsewhere All countries should release all the data they have on Covid-19 research and the viruses closely related to Covid-19 - such as RaTG13 - including the medical records of tests done on human and animal blood samples etc and other tissue China should do this as well and include all data from the Mojiang Miners who died in 2012 of an unknown SARS like Coronavirus This Mojiang Miners information has already unofficially been partly disclosed by researchers in June 2020 who had read and posted the MA and Phd research papers on the Mojiang Miners deaths linking them to a bat coronavirus. The Phd paper was supervised by George Gao current head of the Chinese CDC, and the paper confirmed testing of human samples and the removal of human glands. The MA was done by the Miners hospital Doctor after deaths of the infected Miners -  and also confirmed this testing providing copies of some tests The Miners deaths seems to be made even more important by the fact that their blood and other human samples (tissue and glands) were tested and researched at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere, both in 2012 and 2020 and because of the connection to George Gao. Plus Professor Shi also disclosed in a Nov 2020 Addendum that she knew about and searched for the virus related to the Mojiang Miners death, though in the earlier Nature Magazine article in Feb 2020 Prof Shi said the miners died of a fungal infection, which she must have known to be untrue, while she specifically said no coronavirus was involved in the deaths. It has never been disclosed what coronavirus the Mojiang Miners died of in 2012, though their hospital Dr confirmed in his MA thesis paper title the deaths were believed to be caused by a bat coronavirus contracted in the same Yunnan caves RaTG13 was found in 2013. For those wanting to read the Phd and MA papers see the link to Drs Latham and Wilsons' research at the end of this post which has the embedded links to the Phd and MA papers In Nov 2020 Professor Shi admitted that she and others searched for the Miners virus in the area of the RaTG13 caves for many years after 2013, but did not find RaTG13 again or any other virus that killed the Miners. In 2019 RmYN02 was found in the same area According to an article in the Jewish Press Professor Shi’s team had published their five-year research on surveillance of caves inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in November 2017, just prior to a visit by officials from the US Embassy in 2018, showing the bats they had collected from the cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003. Searching Yunnan and not finding something  does imply that Professor Shi had some idea of the genetic sequence related to both human SARS and the Mojiang Miners virus. It is clear she was looking to match a wild bat coronavirus and according to the BBC more or less did so for the human 2003 SARS virus We do know from Professor Shi that RaTG13 was only ever found once in the fecal samples of one bat but this was initially recorded in the gene database GSA as obtained from a bronchial wash process (which would almost certainly have been performed on the  Mojiang Miners in 2012) but not a bat in the wild. This GSA reference was partly changed to fecal swab in 2020 though references to a bronchial wash process remain in the historical record in webarchive.org Open webarchive links below or view the Twitter snapshot We also know extensive advanced gain of function research work was carried out by Professor Shi in Wuhan on her own after the work was banned, between 2014 until 2017, in the USA. Prof Shi also did gain of function work in conjunction with US bat scientist Prof Ralph Baric and also did work involving Peter Daszak and published joint papers with both men. Both men hold key positions on the LANCET investigation into Covid-19 and Daszak is on the WHO investigation (Daszak was Wuhan in February 2021 as a lead WHO investigator) Further Daszak was in communication about what was happening in Wuhan, as early as 1st January 2020, with George Gao Head of Chinese CDC. Gao's response to Daszak's long message offering help for the SARS like viral outbreak, Daszak had heard about in Wuhan was ""Happy New Year"" Interestingly Gao was, on the 1st of January 2020, already discussing by phone the same then unknown SARS like outbreak with another US Professor - world-famous virologist Ian Lipkin Gao and the Chinese CDC had already  received lab tests showing the genetic sequence was a SARS virus but did not share this information until 11th Jan when a Chinese researcher published his results unofficially If you watch the PBS Frontline Docu from 20 minutes and 20 seconds in you will hear Daszak's own confirmation of his messages with Gao on 1st January 2020 followed by the details from Professor Lipkin of Gao's conversation with Lipkin on 1st Jan 2020. Both Prof Baric and Peter Daszak seem deeply conflicted as Covid-19 investigators or people reviewing Prof Shi and the WIV Professor Richard Ebright has noted, “For persons who were directly involved in funding, promoting, and/or performing bat coronavirus research and bat coronavirus gain-of-function research at WIV, avoiding a possible finding of culpability for triggering a pandemic is a powerful motivator.” And Daszak would be at the very top of the list of those involved in funding, promoting and collaborating in that research. More broadly, as Ebright also notes, Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance has received over $100 million in funding from US government agencies for a variety of virus surveillance and virus gain of function work – the kind of work that could be brought into serious question if Daszak found any evidence it contributed to causing the pandemic. How did The Lancet manage to overlook such an enormous conflict of interest, Ebright wonders, while Dr Filippa Lentzos, an expert on biological threats at King’s College London, tweeted, “Goodness. I can't imagine a lead investigator with more vested interests!” Perhaps a proper investigation could also explain why Prof Shi did no material research into virus RaTG13 for 7 years after 2013, as she quickly identified the RaTG13 gene sequence and later published work, in 2016. RaTG13 was shown as very rare, closely related to human SARS and possibly highly capable of causing a human pandemic Prof Shi's life work centered around finding and researching such rare human pandemic bat coronaviruses, so the lack of interest in this very rare example - RaTG13 -seems unusually strange even unexplicable It is of note that Prof Shi failed to mention that RaTG13 was originally labelled BtCoV/4991 - GenBank KP876546 - and that her published work used the 4991 label, making the connection less clear to the Mojiang Mine and the miners who died of a suspected bat SARS coronavirus caught in the mine. Finally a little more on the Covid-19 timeline and origin. The Daily Mail quotes the Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia who used modelling techniques developed in tracking cancer mutations - to trace the evolution of Sars-Cov-2 back to the  ancestor genome behind the Covid-19 infections worldwide. The study dates the Covid-19  ancestor to mid-October to early November 2019. The Daily Mail says these findings are backed up by a study from scientists in California and Arizona. 'All the genetic evidence makes it clear this virus is from China,' said Sergei Pond, one of the Temple paper's authors. 'The pattern of worldwide spread is also consistent with Chinese viruses seeding epidemics in other countries.' Drs Latham and Wilson for MA and Phd on Moijang Miners Other references Thank you for the details.  It seems that a basic question is still unaddressed. That is: virus research from many countries involves unknown and, shockingly,  unanticipated personal injury risks to collectors and researchers alike, and eventually to the general public, and  then to the global population.  What protocols have to be updated /implemented at both research labs and collection sites  to preclude/markedly reduce the probability of another unanticipated  epidemic/pandemic? The answer seems to be nothing material and there are even calls to allow research in less secure facilities, even though there is a shortage of experienced researchers If you want to know more about this I suggest you read the link below that details a range of issues from a Covid-19  lab accident at a major US University high security coronavirus lab involving a mouse with an engineered Covid-19 virus through to a FOIA info release about disarmed anthrax spores being engineered with inserts of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (which allows the virus to gain entry into human cells) into Bacillus Anthracis which is the causative agent of anthrax. I suggest you also watch the video about GMO by Dr Latham who was actively involved in GMO editing processes. He explains in some detail why the process poses big risks by regularly accidently creating unknown gene insertions. How many are undetected is unknown as they are not obvious. It is also disturbing that virus and bacteria genes get inserted, some of which are genes whose natural purpose in a virus is to allow the virus to infect the host The implication for humans if human gut bacteria gets infected by a rouge GMO with a bacterial gene insert could be very serious as the human bacteria may then be able to pass on to the human host a new type of infection I am writing a post on this whole subject and may just dump the data I have got so far separately. Here is part of the info I have got from Dr Latham from my draft Covid-19 and GMO post The “deal” that big science struck with the government was that, in return for not being directly regulated, principal investigators (PIs) would take personal responsibility for lab biosafety, involve the public in decision-making, and accept public accountability for their actions. This has not happened as is set out later. It also creates conflicts of interest as those involved both regulate themselves and report on breaches of safety which may effect funding. According to Richard Ebright epidemiologist from Rutgers University “The UNC incident shows that serious laboratory accidents with SARS-CoV-2 can occur even in a lab having extremely extensive experience in BSL-3 operations and unmatched expertise in coronavirus research, and underscores the risks associated with uncontrolled proliferation of research on SARS-CoV-2, especially for labs lacking prior experience in BSL-3 operations and coronavirus research.” Thank you for the data references.  This reality is worrisome to say the least. I suggest you read and watch all of Dr Latham's and Dr Wilson's posts videos and blogs. They  publish peer reviewed research etc etc but have no corporate or political agenda which means their research is not restricted or censored and they have helped expose regulatory and corporate fraud that has damaged peoples lives - the poison papers As you will see there is an on going lack of understanding in how little regulation and oversight there has been on GMO activities In 2006, Drs. Allison K Wilson and Jonathan R Latham co-founded the Bioscience Resource Project to conduct independent scientific analysis of genetic engineering and its risks. They later enlarged the project to include other aspects of the science of food and agriculture and their impacts on health and the environment. They created the Bioscience Resource Project website to serve as a hub where independent-minded scientists could publish timely comment and analysis. The website also included links to eye-opening and classic scientific articles and the websites of other public interest organizations. The goal was to publish and make widely available the Project’s research and that of a diverse group of public interest scientists and organizations worldwide. In so doing, the Bioscience Resource Project aimed to create a strong scientific foundation for healthy, just and ecologically sound food and agricultural systems. In 2008, the Bioscience Resource Project became a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit. is co-founder and Executive Director of the Bioscience Resource Project and the Editor of . Dr Latham is also the Director of the which publicizes documents of the chemical industry and its regulators. Dr. Latham holds a Masters degree in Crop Genetics and a PhD in Virology. He was subsequently a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Genetics, University of Wisconsin, Madison. He has published scientific papers in disciplines as diverse as plant ecology, plant virology, genetics and genetic engineering. Dr Latham talks frequently at international events and scientific and regulatory conferences on the research conducted by the Project. He has written for Truthout, MIT Technology Review, the Guardian, Resilience, Salon.com, and many other magazines and websites.

IF NOT FOR U DO IT FOR THE ONES U CARE ABOUT IF U EVEN HAVE ANYONE Thank you for the details The unprecedented pandemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China and beyond has had major public health impacts on a global scale [1, 2]. Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomic analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein."

And of that 40% - 10% will develop long Covid (Maybe for life), I just can't bring myself to accept those odds and start living a normal life again. My wife and I have been in continuous lockdown now since April 2020. We are loosing our minds Here in the UK the Government is either overtly or covertly liking that the double jabbed are then getting covid because they get it without being hospitalised and end up with a more robust immunity to all the covid variants We must remember that the current vaccine is designed to repel the spike protein of the original Wuhan strain only Getting covid means you have fought the whole of the virus and not just the spike protein Thanks ROG - I can see that this sneeky way of making immune systems more robust is a likely plan - but even getting covid only gives us 5 months immunity before we can catch it again - and all the time the risk of long covid hangs over us Look up info on B and T cells They are different to the 5/6 months of active antibodies Is this good news ? Are you saying that if we actually get covid and have had 2 jabs - than we have  a longer period to enjoy immunity . I'm a lazy and impatient reader of things -(B & T cells)  can you tell me what the length of time would be increased to please B and T cells can last a lifetime You get these after having the MMR vaccine as an example You also get them for each of the flu vaccines but as we know that vaccine changes every year so you will have a multitude of different ones Does this help - This may also help Thanks for those links - I will digest them tomorrow. But in short the press and government has told that we can get covid over and over again. Are you saying this is not correct or are you saying that with 2 jabs AND getting covid that we become totally immune to the virus (current strains) Using the official WHO stats 1 in a million get covid twice 1 in 80 million who get it twice die from it But I've heard of many people getting Covid twice on LBC radio.general media and here say. Are these stats for those having had covid or for those having had 2 jabs and covid . Sorry to be a pain but the idea of catching covid being a one off cure to catching it again is entirely new to me, I was convinced that it could be caught many times unknown as to what their situations were Maybe in years to come we may catch it many times super mildly but that is currently unknown My GUESS is that we will and the B/T cells will kill it within a few hours or less in the same way they do for many other viruses I had covid in early march 2020 then gave it to the rest of my family We all had different symptoms with my 30+ year old daughter getting the classic dry cough and bad sweats for a week I had a week of conjunctivitis after 2 days of feeling really crap We all now have T and B cells which will go into action should it try again - maybe it has and none of us know about it !! I have had no jabs because what would be the point? - the vaccine cannot do more in regards to fighting it again Hi Rog - I've looked a little deeper into the B/T cell effects and there are so many conflicting opinions. Some top scientists warn of a limited immunity period for those who have had the virus and other are less sure Many suggest 2 jabs plus booster are vital even if you have had covid - other top scientist are not so convinced. I think I just might consult a witch doctor and see what he / she thinks about it all. I certainly remain most  alarmed about any mixing with any other humans and so will stay indoors. You are likely to stay indoors for years with that viewpoint but only you can decide what happens from here Where do you get these statistics from? Here is link (quote from the article) that gives scientific information. "" between December 2020 and July, the health was tracked of more than 1.2 million adults who received one coronavirus jab and 971,504 who received two jabs in that time frame. ""H That is not conflicting and it may be misunderstanding what you are reading... The two positions are: scientists are unsure how long immunity lasts. Scientists think you can become reinfected as little as 3 months after having been infecting. Both scenarios are clear, immunity DOES NOT last... The only debate is how long it lasts."

We have to consume living matter to continue our own living.  Life comes from and continues on, from the living. Plants can't live in sterile soil.  Only the small invisible life, can turn the non-living into components for the living.  The small invisible life....has many times the mass of the visible life. But you don't see it.

How does the WHO or other major organizations like the CDC track or count a “Recovered” case? In other words,  what determines that a Coronavirus case is considered to be “Recovered”? sincerely, stephen I am with you here. Well, the stats can't show accuracy unless it includes total number of tests... Total tested/Negative/Positive/Hospitalized/Recovered/Deaths … then we can see what is really going on. But WHO has this collective of Stats?? MnM By WHO , I mean the World Health Organization (WHO) Does anyone know how a coronavirus case is deemed to be in “recovered” state? sincerely, stephen I believe it has to be reported through the healthcare system.  In the US, you have personally identifiable information that links to your case and outcome.  If you get a test, your information is gathered.  If you never call back or show up as returning in the ""system"", then one may infer that you had a mild case and recovered, although I don't know if that is actually the way they are recording the metric (they would assume you got better if you never showed up again for a certain period - say 14 day).  When I think of 'recovered' I think of a case that was admitted to a hospital and later was discharged, and then wasn't seen again after a certain period, like maybe a week, or there was a subsequent test that showed no more coronavirus.  People that are exposed during a quarantine situation (eg a cruise ship) are closely tracked. Those are just the mechanics I can think of.  I'm not a nurse or doctor, just an engineer with my own view of these thing. EDIT:  I would assume the CDC is reporting once a day on the major stats, and they have access to case outcomes for the US health system.  They probably have queries that filter out cases diagnosed as COVID-19.  John Hopkins either has similar access, or just grabs the CDC report.  Something like that.  I could be wrong.

With the high amount of virus transmission at the moment in the UK, I would think its a risky endevour, especially considering your own circumstances; there was a recently documented instance of covid spread resulting from an airplane journey (incidentally to Ireland): Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who fronts CIDRAP out of University of Minnesota, recently addressed the matter of air travel during the pandemic on his weekly podcast. I would refer you to his opinion so as to help you make a more informed decision for your family. You can listen to the whole 1hr audio podcast here: Here is the transcript from the above podcast on this topic: [00:41:53] All right. So now to the questions about travel and the upcoming holidays. I'll start with another listener e-mail. This one from Lisa who writes, 'My question is about air travel. How safe is it? My mother, who's ninety one, lives alone in Florida. So far, I've not traveled down to her. There may come a time before this pandemic is over, based on your 12 to 14 month projection that I will need to go down to her. It's a three hour ride. Is there a way to protect myself? Would I need an N95 mask? Would it be better to drive down? If I drive, are public bathroom is safe?' So Mike, what do we know about coronavirus transmission with travel in the weeks to months ahead? [00:42:30] This is a very difficult one because the information is quite incomplete. And let me just tell you that I wrestle with this from a very personal perspective. You know, prior to this pandemic, I was almost a two hundred thousand mile a year flier. I spent a lot of days, not just hours, days on airplanes. I've not been on a plane since March. And I don't have any interest in getting into plane right now. Now, I'll try to be very measured in my comments because I understand the implications they may have for the travel industry. I surely don't want to create, you know, some kind of controversy about this, but I think that there's still a lot of unknowns and uncertainties about let's just cover air travel first. I actually have had experience with infectious disease and air travelers, having worked up several outbreaks when I was at the state of Minnesota, or at least potential outbreaks where airplanes were involved. One of the most notable cases was an individual who flew from Europe to Minneapolis, then on to the Mayo Clinic with a highly drug resistant TB and HIV. And it turned out that on his sputum when he was seen at the Mayo Clinic, it was a four plus. In other words, it lit up like a Christmas tree. And so we had grave concerns about the potential transmission there. I've worked on measles situations, etcetera. So I will just tell you one thing that planes today, the air quality is much, much superior to what it was several decades ago. And people were even allowed to smoke because the filters in the planes actually clogged up quickly with the tar in nicotine made the filters largely inoperable at that time. So what happens in a plane? Let's just take where you're seated, what's going on. This is actually a good news situation. The planes do have a ventilation system that actually meets requirements for even COVID patients in isolation rooms. They have anywhere from 10 to 12 air changes per hour. The air actually comes out of the top. And this is why that air coming outside of your vent can be important. And then its basically driven to the floor and then it goes into the side of the body of the plane and into the filters recycled back. Depending on how the plane is being run, and what I mean by that is there's what we call bleed air, it bleeds off the engine, which actually takes more energy to have more air recirculation, but it delivers about 50 percent air from the engine, 50 percent recirculated air, with that recirculated air going through that HEPA filter. And so from that perspective, actually, this is a pretty good situation. If I had to be seated next to somebody it'd be a lot safer than being seated next to, for example, in a theater. But it's not a guarantee. If you're sitting next to someone who is infected, you don't know who they are and you both are masked, you still have a real possibility of becoming infected, given that the low dose likely of infection for SARS-CoV-2, could very well happen there even before the virus was driven into those next filters. So at this point, I would say the airline industry has done about as much as it can in terms of the planes themselves. But clearly, we can't say no. We can say it truly is a much safer event than, say, riding on a bus or something like that. So the challenge we have then is what does this all mean? Well, don't forget, the travel is much more than just sitting an airplane, even with a mask on. It's getting to the airport if you take a cab. It's in the airport terminal itself. It's what I often jokingly say is the cattle car at the gate. It's getting in close contact with the people coming down the gate down to the jetway. It is waiting for your bags at the baggage claim. It's all of those things that also add to this. And then when you are somewhere else, the question is, are you actually in a private residence or in a public area? Are you eating out at restaurants, etcetera, etcetera? That's been one of the challenges of trying to understand what the risk of transmission has been. There have been several studies now done of what appeared to be isolated, and I want to emphasize isolated outbreaks on planes of one or two people sitting next to someone who was infected, but today, you can't know who is infected on these planes. You just don't know who that person is sitting next to you for three hours. And if you have your face cloth covering on, you know, again, you're going to be afforded potentially some protection if they have one on, but as I said, I don't believe that's going to be nearly enough necessarily to prevent you from becoming infected. So what do we need to know? Well, first of all, we really have very, very poor data on who's flying and who's getting infected and what the potential risk exposure might be. Health departments are strapped to look at this issue. We've looked at health department collected data, a very outstanding story in The Washington Post, did a similar kind of analysis. And the bottom line is it's really incomplete because first off, I'm flying and I've become positive three days after my flight and I become clinically ill, five days, whatever. Was it the flight that did it? Was it at the airport? Was it in the cab? Was it some other part of that experience that got me exposed? And we just don't know. In addition to that, if you look at just how many people have been exposed to someone on a flight, this is where the CDC basically in this September 19th article by Ian Duncan in The Washington Post, really laid out the fact that there had been at least 11000 people who had been exposed to coronavirus on flights for which we have very poor information about who they are. Did they fall ill with this infection? What are their testing, etc.? So my bottom line message on a plane right now for those in the airline industry, I surely don't want to make life difficult for you, but I will avoid flying for as long as I can at this point until we have hopefully a vaccine that is going to be much more protective and reduce the number of infected people. Do I think that the airlines industry is doing what it can to reduce transmission? I think so. I think the do not fly list for people who won't wear a mask is fair. I support that issue. I would love to see right now more studies done, particularly seroprevalence studies done in flight attendants. Let's see if they are, in a sense, the canary in the coal mine, unfortunately, I hate to say that its not meant with disrespect, but if they're showing up with an increased percentage of people positive, that gives us some evidence that, in fact, airline flight is a challenge. We don't have those data. Those data should be collected and should be part of an ongoing assessment, as critical as this is. So from that part of travel, I have a challenge. Now, let me take it to the road trip up travel. That's where you're in your vehicle, you're traveling. And I think actually that can be done much more safely. You know, if you're going from point A to point B, even several nights long, I think that you surely can pump gasoline safely. The one challenge will be using the bathrooms. I understand that. And, you know, that's in and out, clearly wearing the mask in and out. But it's also one where, you know, again, unless there is someone who is in there just prior to you and ventilation is very poor, the idea of the very limited time period of using the bathroom is such that I believe that the risk of a infectious dose exposure is quite low. Staying in hotels, you know, if someone hasn't been in the room and the ventilation system has been working, I don't worry about the surface contamination, as we've talked about before. Part of hygiene theater, I worry about the air and I find those rooms not likely to have enough virus, even if the housekeeping people were in there several hours before to be any kind of a challenge in terms of transmission. So I think you can stay at a hotel, you know, check in quickly, mask. Don't wait around. And so if I were going to travel right now, that's how I'd do it. I would see the world in a car or an RV or whatever you want to do. And so to answer your question about, you know, should you go see your mother or not? Lisa, I would say please go see your mother. Don't wait. Go do it now. You know, do it twice. Do it three times. And if I were you, I would get in a car and travel. And that to me would make me feel most comfortable. You know, take time right now you say, well, it's a lot easier to do a three hour flight to Florida than it is to drive there taking two or three days. You know, this is COVID time. Use it. And so I would say that's the one thing I would do. And at this point, I will know when I personally feel whatever this intangible is that I have between my professional knowledge and my personal feelings is when I can go back into an orchestra hall and feel confident when I listen to the music or watch the play that I'm comfortable being there. And that when I get back in an airplane. And when that happens, you know, then I'll know I'm there and I'll share that with you. Thank you PseudaFed for such a comprehensive and useful response, it really has helped, it's a difficult and emotional decision, we haven't seen them for a year and want to but for there safety and our own (we are that much older of course) it's probably a good idea to be a little more patient ... good of you to take the time ... Roger Thank you for the information , you answered my question! Your Government (?) site doesnt appear the best but has information here- I am not sure what you would do whilst in Great Britain (UK?) other than stay indoors with family and the occassional walk out, but it may be best to pick a late Spring/ Summer visit rather than a time when coronavirus strains are most rampant.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/why-does-uk-need-to-know-about-infection-cases-now.5897/,Why does UK need to know about infection cases now?,"The UK has steadily falling hospitalisations and deaths even with new variants about so why does the UK need to bother about who has the virus and why make those that have it isolate? Todays data shows the R rate and infection cases are rising a little but at the same time hospitalisations and deaths are falling all due to the vaccine rollout To me it seems that the scientists are unsure about the consequences of relaxing covid-19 protective protocols.  A rising R naught is a worrisome indicator; however, economic pressures are immense.  Perhaps the authorities are ""hedging their bets"" by maintaining vigorous data collection. Note: Argentina, Brazil, India are cautionary examples . The R number used to be worrisome in the UK but is not anymore - in fact it never gets mentioned now by Government There are still a lot of people susceptible to infection and virus transmission is still high. Abandoning any consideration of the virus at this point would likely lead to a lot of illness, hospitalisations and deaths. How would it? We in the UK already have slightly rising infections which ARE NOT leading to hospitalisations and deaths We are still living with restrictions designed to limit the spread of infection. If we abandoned any consideration of the virus and went back to life as it was Feb 2020, the virus would quickly spread amongst those susceptible to infection, especially the many yet to be vaccinated and a number of those people will get seriously ill and die.  Allowing uncontrolled, and high levels of transmission would also give more opportunities for the virus to encounter and evolve against the immune systems of vaccinated people, which could risk undermining the vaccines and again lead to more people getting ill. The only people in the UK going into hospital are those over 40 who CHOSE not to be vaccinated We have been told by our experts in the UK that we will have to live with this virus for the short. medium and long term no matter what the infection rates For those who have a supressed immune system it will be an issue as they will have to decide whether to isolate forever or get on with life in general - there is no other choice for them as far as I can see.... If the virus does mutate enough to get past the current vaccination then we are told that it is fairly easy to produce a new variant vaccine based on the current one We will know if a mutated virus does start to get past the vaccine by hospital rates rising not by testing for infections Thats not true -some people who have been vaccinated have been hospitalised with the new Indian variant. This is an example of why we need to proceed carefully and minimise the chances of more variants emerging; as much as it is easy to make new vaccines with adjusted antibody targets, these take time and money to roll out. It seems certain that the virus will remain endemic now, so yes we will have to live with it, but we will live with it with some widespread immunity -hopefully rendering its effects akin to the seasonal coronaviruses. We arent at that stage yet, with a large majority of the country still to be fully vaccinated, and so the virus is still potentially very serious for a lot of people, especially those you mention and others who may not be able to get vaccinated for particular health reasons. If we weren't bothered about who had the virus then we would not be bothered about variants such as the 'Indian' and any future.... Our outlook would be 'we hope mutations [that may or may not exist] are captured by the vaccines'. Don;t forget we track all cases of infection, whether measles or influenza strains, so it would be weird to not track a virus that is impacting us so much. Finally, no vaccine is 100% effective and if it is noted infection is increasing it serves as an early warning system as to whether a) the virus is starting to affect younger people, b) a mutation has occurred or been brought in we are not aware of, c) a targeted approach to a group or area that for whatever reason are against vaccination. It allows movement of resources... It makes no sense to have resources spread and try and react at short notice to a problem. You come across as saying if they don;t help themselves, stuff them... Those that believe that live in a naive bubble that avoids education and common sense... I, and most people will come into contact with these people and as I said above, vaccines are not 100% effective, so although I am conscientious, did what I could and followed rules... I may find myself ill from someone that hasnt been supported. Easy to produce, but not roll-out/ administer otherwise there wouldn;t be 'bad' flu seasons. ROG - I am confused as under the Livescience Thread 'Pub Closure', as recently as 3-4 weeks ago you were arguing about schools re-opening and that infection rates are set to in increase. At one point you say ' UK school holls were February 12 to 22 and March 27 to April 12 On the graph those dates are where the graph has the definable slants then following those the line is virtually level again but stays at the lower level they were brought down to by the closures Next week of school holls is May 29 to June 7 so I expect the same to happen again The start of the Summer holls is mid July until the start of September and if this trend continues then the infection rates should drop to almost zero and stay there especially as by that time virtually all UK adults will be vaccinated ' Regardless of your position you specifically call out tracking infection rates until the start of September. What has changed in the 3/ 4 weeks between arguing for action to reduce infections up until September and asking if we need to track infection rates?"

For a virus to be used as a vector it should  show following properties- SARS-CoV-2 passes most of these conditions, being a zoonotic virus it is highy pathogenic and has high copy number. It is ""sly as a fox"" in avoiding immunosurvillance of the body as some people who got vaccinated also got infected. The genomic capacity is ~30kb [ ] which is similar to adenovirus vector. For low cytotoxicity we can use vaccination as an armour because survivability chances are higher in people who are vaccinated. The only thing that bothers me is the ligation of the desired gene in the vector and its expression in the host cell which could only be proven after experimental analysis.

I am based in the UK and what I have mostly experienced/ observed close to home are- Opposition party using COVID as a weapon against the current Government, Government criticized for acting too late on closing boarders (3 weeks after a mutation discovery) and then acting too quickly to close borders (3 days after a mutation discovery) Sweden held as  champion on how to deal with COVID19 whereas other countries in Europe failed (2020). Sweden having an inquiry on its failed response to COVID19 (2021). Arguments over vaccine distribution and countries attempting to 'jump' queues to get their populations protected. Public ignoring quarantines and rules and then complaining that restrictions cannot be lifted quickly due to continued virus spread. Public refusing vaccinations and complaining their operations are delayed as hospitals still have patients [that didnt have vaccines]. So on... Is COVID highlighting, in our lifetime, that world co-operation genuinely is for show whereas the reality is co-operation and a common goal just isnt going to be achievable? If one has a personality quirk, (e.g.: schizoid),  dislikes people in general,  despises politicians, likes working from home in the basement, views the TV re-runs, and usually has bad breath from eating left over slightly molded pizza,  those covid-19 masking, distancing, and confinement regulations don't seem that odious.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/how-does-the-new-coronavirus-compare-with-the-flu.739/,How does the new coronavirus compare with the flu?,"How does the new coronavirus compare with the seasonal flu, and which should you most worry about? Comparing the flu to the new coronavirus is like comparing apples and oranges. The new coronavirus has only been infecting humans for about a month while the flu has been infecting humans for more than half a year. The flu wasn't even being reported on in its first month. This coronavirus seems to be more infective than the flu and more deadly. Did you read The Lancet article? You are spreading misinformation. 75% of the patients had bilateral pneumonia. This virus is not comparable to the flu. I completely agree. The Lancet article was specifically about people who had pneumonia and not everyone who had the 2019 novel coronavirus.  So, yes, 75% had double pneumonia and the other 25% had single pneumonia. ""In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia."" I was freaked out till I learned what we could do to stay safe Mostly ""wash your hands!"" It just scares me You realize this study was conducted on hospitalized patients, right?  What percentage of hospitalized flu patients do you think have complications like pneumonia, sepsis, shock, etc?  I'm a physician who takes care of hospitalized patients, including many flu patients, every year and the answer is pretty much all of them--otherwise they wouldn't have been admitted to the hospital. With that said, current data does suggest that this nCoV-19 is more infectious and far deadlier than the flu.  However, current data is limited in many ways and both its infectivity and especially its mortality rate is likely to drop significantly with more data. The bottom line is, should we take this seriously?  Yes?  Should we be scared about it and let it affect our lives any more than be more careful of our hygiene and avoid contact with overtly sick people?  No. Where did you get the stat for ""more than half a year""? The stat on CDC gives at most 5 months If R0 of coronavirus is more than Seasonal flu, so Why in Fact the rate of the Flue is so much more than cov19?! I mean the affected people and hospitalization rates. Flu has such a more hospitalization that with  0.05% of Death rate, yet has nearly 6x more than Cov_19!!!! So how Can I solve this contradictary informations?! I'm curious as to why more data becoming available could have an impact on the mortality rate? Thanks! The flu spreads every year from many points of existing infection.  It never dies out.  It just changes its dominant hemisphere.  Covid-19 started from a single point in China this year, so it was at a transmission disadvantage compared to the flu.  That explains how the R0 for covid-19 can be higher than the flu even though covid-19 has fewer cases this year than the flu. Because most of the data has been gathered at hospitals where the most serious cases end up.  It stands to reason that deaths would be overrepresented in that setting.  I think the best data to watch is the mortality rate from those infected on the cruise ship since that was a closed system.  I believe there are 3 deaths out of 700 so far, but the infection is still spreading and it's too early to draw any conclusions from that.  We should know more in a month or so after the virus has run its course completely on that subgroup. From what I'm reading, hearing, from medical officials, Washington, China, and other countries,World Health Organization, and I am objective, I don't call it a flu"" but a virus that' s to be taken very serious. Think of others to be of service  . Time to come together, fight this thing. Here is some issues off the bat. Most articles are trying to compare the Flu in America to the COVID-19 in China as numbers. They didn't include any statistics on the Flu in China to compare to the COVID-19. Here is something even worse, it's best to use data from when the Flu first appeared compared to when COVID-19 appeared. The reason for this is because we have better ways at combating the Flu compared to the COVID-19 since it's a new virus. Based on statistics, a total of 87,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported but only about 3,000 have resulted in a death where 42,000 have already recovered from it. The Flu of 2009 which lasted a little more of a year claimed a lot more lives, the Flu of 2009 killed well over 200,000+ people and infected well over 700 million people, again the main cause of death was the respiratory. Health Corporations like to cause panic in order for vaccines and treatments to be sold so they could get a profit, this was seen during the Flu of 2009 in which corporations pressured WHO (World Health Organization)  in order for corporations to make profits. Profits from causing fear in innocent people's lives?  I will never understand people.  I've felt like that from my cardiologist , giving me meds with affects that hurt me more, most I quit, My question is,  is there an incubation period for COVID-19?  My impression is that it’s contagious for 14 days prior to one showing symptoms — Is this true, and is a true for all cases? That would make it very hard to stop an pandemic. From what I read SARS was contaned because it wasn’t contagious until one showed symptoms of it. So they were able to quarantine the one with SARS immediately and eventually track down everyone who had it. If you can’t tell who have corona virus and you can’t test of everyone, it seems very difficult to stop it. Secondly, how contagious is it? Hundreds of people on the cruiseship acquiring it, or 50 people in the Washington nursing home getting it in a few days seems quite telling. It's more deadly and more contagious than seasonal flu, and nothing can stop it.  We're all going to get it, or its vaccine.  Everything you read is just your government telling you that you're outta luck. To my mind, this phrase means that, for our purposes, two items have zero in common, and any comparison between the two is literally meaningless, as we can learn absolutely nothing from such a discussion. Is this your intent? If not, can you please clarify? i agree it is sad Medical professionals (certain) give credence to the virus leading to (Disease) of the lungs, Meaning if you have the virus and test negative after treatment or after fighting to recoup and you do. A person (may develope lung disease) . Even after the virus, related to the virus directly. No! Only certain individuals like myself, older, heart disease,  health conditions, respiratory and immune problems. But I do believe Israel doctors say they will have a vaccine, Until then be kind to others, help if you can, be of service, ask questions, pray, and be more than you are, We all hope warm weather will affect the virus to kill it someway. But we are all affected by it in ways together. Be positive. I would think a vaccine would be hard since common colds are also, often, caused by a type of coronavirus and I don't believe they have a vaccine for the common cold yet. ""Unclear"", ""working to determine"", ""still trying to understand"". Don't do a comparison if you don't have the facts. This page was a complete waste of time.

Accurate statistics by age groups are not available and there is a marked distrust about the vaccines' effectiveness.  The current public conviction is:  that  the SARS-Cov-2 virus was most likely manufactured in the Wuhan Lab as a surreptitious joint effort that was inappropriately managed.  Consequently, governments don't really know what can happen. That being said.  The vaccines in the U.S. have been demonstrated to be effective at both preventing and mitigating covid-19 and its current variants.  Those with questions about the vaccines should consult their doctors and do their research.

The question you may be better to ask (after finding out of true) would be, why havent all sailors been offered a vaccine?

The Astra Zeneca vaccine  produces good level of T cells which can help offset the decline in effective antibodies.  I have a mixture of Pfizer and Astra. Of course these vaccines were designed to combat the original virus not the mutated varieties.   March next year may see the introduction of Omicron targeted vaccines. The vaccines will buy time for, hopefully, the virus to evolve to a very mild strain.   The tendency for the mutants to be more infectious means they may replace the older nasty varieties.

But that may actually be a good thing. I am no scientiest but what i have briefly researched in 18 minutes was that the organization of the coronavirus genome i viewed in a jpeg and i have and question at the end.  So the Coronavirus virus particles contain four main structural proteins. These are the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, all of which are encoded within the 3′ end of the viral genome i viewed. To successfully initiate an infection, viruses need to overcome the cell membrane barrier. Enveloped viruses achieve this by membrane fusion, a process mediated by specialized viral fusion proteins The S protein (∼150 kDa), utilizes an N-terminal signal sequence to gain access to the ER, and is heavily N-linked glycosylated. Homotrimers of the virus encoded S protein make up the distinctive spike structure on the surface of the virus. The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and mediates attachment to the host receptors. So can we use stem cells to create proteins as we kill off the original proteins that are injected with the virus to counter act its offensive objective and thats to over come the membrane barrier? Can we use stem cells? You were in right! Some still think that the virus may enter cells by endocytosis. Have read a couple of research papers (eff. Jan 2020) and some are referring to SARS-COv-2 as being bi-phasic. First round low mortality rate.....second round....high mortality rate due to it being an RNA virus and being able to reassort its genomic expression to adapt. Because the viral spike glycoprotein (S) utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host protein receptor I would think it prudent to consider using an ACE2 inhibitor like Monteleukast or Symbicort to prevent the virus spike from binding to the host receptor. Read this: Neither Monteleukast or Symbicort are ACE2 inhibitors. Ikarugamycin and Molsidomine  are examples of ACE2 inhibitors. Some infectious disorders and consequences have been treated with stem cell therapy. Stem cells do have a powerful secretory role, which aids in the development of new blood vessels, cell proliferation, and differentiation, as well as reducing the inflammatory reaction. I believe them cells technology is an important tool for treating long Covid. What are the chances that a new Covid-19 mutation will surface sometime in the Spring? 100%.... There will even have been some whilst I typed this response. Do virologists know why the virus keeps mutating so rapidly? I wouldn;t say it is mutating rapidly, especially when you compare to flu which has been with us for generations and has multiple mutations ahead of any given season."

There are many arguments why which have ranged from poor Government responses in the UK, slow reactions, under-funding for healthcare systems over the years etc... The current world of political correctness and fear of offending people in my opinion has caused a lot of unnecessary deaths and no government would realistically make the following suggestion- The UK has recorded a large number of Covid deaths, especially when comparing to other nations but we have to remember that we have kept many people alive that would not survive in other nations.  We have created generations of [morbidly] obese people which again we have been able to keep alive where other nations are unable to. The reality of the situation we have a population susceptible to ill-health and we re limited on how many years we can artificially add to life expectancy, so when a new illness occurs, it is the success of our successive healthcare that we suffer the greatest now. I wonder how much validity is in the above and how the Government can slowly maneuver the population without being called a nanny state. Personal opinion:  The covid-19 pandemic information from start to on-going is rife with incompetence, mendacity, cupidity, stupidity and hubris from scientists, politicians and people.  For individuals, the immediate priorities are to get vaccinated. and to follow the safety guidelines.  Any data about the pandemic morbidity and mortality should be considered incomplete  if not suspect. I do not disagree with you but if you had the above situations playing out exactly in two identical countries, one with an average age of 60 and another with an average age of 40 I would argue that COVID is more dangerous to the elderly, so the country with average age 60 would suffer. I would also argue that medical care and medications have kept people alive whom would not have survived even 30 year ago, so we have more elderly. The elderly are now forming large groups whether retirement villages, care homes or holiday homes e.g. Spain - The first peak of deaths occurred around February 2020 which for me was insufficient time for countries to react to a situation and occurred in predominantly people that would not have been alive if the medical position was equivalent to the 1970s. Per the above posts, Roj5,  whose points are apropos and well taken.   I agree that life expectancy in developed and some developing countries has been extended since the 1970's.  Such for me is/was a laudable achievement based upon economics especially the global economy.  What now might lessen that situation, (and literally frightens me),  is the fact that covid-19 has many variants which for now mostly target the 65+ age range, and those with certain underlying medical conditions irrespective of age. However, that seems to be changing due to virus mutation.  Yes. Two identical countries with different average ages would experience markedly different morbidity and mortality total numbers , (not average per 100K),  given the pandemic conditions of the last year.  The current global mortality rate, (mortality divided by morbidity) is ~2+% based upon incomplete and questionable data.  The infuriating aspect is that since 2017 a pandemic was anticipated, however, when that happened truth was suppressed/denied and medical resources were overburdened/lacking/not used, (my observation in the U.S.).  OK! I'll cease ranting. I agree that life expectancy in developed and some developing countries has been extended since the 1970's.

However, that seems to be changing due to virus mutation. Yes. Almost 2 two years into the covid-19 pandemic not much improvement in the way of usable statistical reporting has occurred.  Nor has any accountability been clarified.  In the U.S., a 2nd booster shot for those 65 and older is now recommended. I recommend that before getting the 2nd booster, check with ones' health care provider.  Note: the current covid-19 Home Test has an approx. 15% error rate.  Feel free to do the Bayesian statistics before spending any hard earned money.  The future outcome in the developed world appears to be an annual or semi-annual covid-19 booster shot(s) akin to the annual flu shot which is modulated for the recipient's age.

Because we left the virus to mutate so that resistant variants will have an advantage and become dominant. He also expects more dangerous variants. As far as i understand he mean non neutralizing antibodies take over when the virus is resistant to neutralizing abs. Usually dangerous variants can´t spread well but what about now when so many got the shots? I´m actually told by a very credible source that some ADHD meds will help for what is coming. Not sure if it´s a specific medication or why. I read these meds can increase methylation. Can that explain why? What do you think of his thoughts? The first parts about the danger of mass vaxxing this way seems obvious to me. An interview with Bossche from April. ""Risk of rapid evolutionary escape from biomedical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein The deployment of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 brings the question of mutational escape from antibody prophylaxis to the forefront. Rapid evolutionary evasion of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) poses a number of threats to biomedical interventions aimed at bringing the virus under control, namely the risk of reduced vaccinal efficacy over time as resistant variants continue to emerge (which may or may not be rectifiable with annual vaccine updates), the risk of waning effectiveness of natural immunity as a result of evasion of common nAbs, and the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)."" ""COVID vaccines can't keep up with new Omicron subvariants New subvariants of the strain of the COVID-19 virus ""appear to be even more immune-resistant than the original,"" Wednesday. The original Omicron strain was , but that's old hat by now. All the cool kids are getting BA.4, or even BA.5. Unfortunately, while the virus has moved on, vaccine makers are stuck in the past."" From Vanden Bossches paper: Natural selection of new, O-glycosylated variants, which I have predicted to rapidly emerge ( ),would allow to overcome binding of both, potentially infection-inhibiting (i.e., neutralizing) Abs directed at theimmuno dominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) and potentially ‘ infection’-inhibiting (note 2) (i.e., virulence-mitigating) Abs directed at the conserved antigenic site within the N-terminal domain of S protein (S-NTD). Consequently,O-glycosylation of the S-RBD would overcome population-level immune pressure that results from boosting of vaccine-primed Abs directed at conserved NTD-specific epitopes that cross-protect against severe disease. This is because NTD-associated ‘ infection’-inhibiting (i.e., virulence mitigating) epitopes will be shielded against their corresponding Abs by the O-glycosites inserted at the predicted O-glycosylation sites of the new variants (New covariants). At the same time, these O-glycosites would also shield RBD-associated infection-inhibiting (i.e., neutralizing) epitopes against their corresponding Abs. Natural selection of the O-glycosylated variants would, therefore, enable SC-2 to effectively counter the growing virus-neutralizing and virulence-mitigating capacity of a highly vaccine-experienced population that is exposed to Omicron, and thereby relieve the pressure on the viral life cycle. The more Omicron expands in prevalence and the more frequently vaccinees get re-exposed and fall victim to breakthrough infections, the higher the prevalence of both elevated virulence-mitigating anti-S Abs will become.  The higher this prevalence and the higher the anti-S Ab titers, the higher the site occupancy of the predicted O-glycosylation sites will need to be for Newco variants to resist the infection-inhibiting immune response of Omicron-infected vaccinees. This is because more densely O-glycosylated variants will more effectively prevent mitigation of viral virulence. Given the population-level immune pressure caused by the exposure of highly vaccinated populations to the highly infectious Omicron, Newco variants will primarily rely on glycosite instead of amino acid mutations in their RBD to gain the required fitness advantage in a landscape of increasing population-level immune pressure on S-NTD. This already explains why the upcoming Newco variants are likely to evolve to a super variant that is not only highly infectious but also highly virulent and fully resistant to C-19 vaccines, including those that have been adapted to the spike protein of the circulating variant. This is why the authors of this paper are desperately wrong in thinking that tailoring the vaccines to the polypeptide sequence of S on the dominantly circulating variant would have a beneficial effect on the outcome of the mass vaccination program. On the contrary, usage of so-called ‘updated’ vaccines to continue this program will only aggravate the outcome due to further boosting of anti-NTD Ab titers. :In the absence of large scale antiviral prophylaxis, the vicious circle of steadily increasing immune pressure causing steadily rising infection rates will ultimately drive highly vaccinated populations to promote the expansion of a super variant that will likely be featured by full resistance to potentially neutralizing epitopes (due to lack of immunogenicity of these epitopes) combined with a high propensity to cause Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (ADEI; facilitated by the infection-enhancing Abs) and a high propensity for causing ADEI-mediated Ab-dependent enhancement of disease (ADED).This is how the evolutionary dynamics of the virus will unfold and how the end station of this misguided mass vaccination program will look. ‍ Basically if i understand Bossche the problem is the narrow protection from the shot + immune imprinting. So when the virus is resistant infections in the vaxxed lead to a boost of non neutralizing abs. It becomes a vicious circle. Those abs prevent severe disease but eventually the virus will likely mutate to variants that will overcome that immune pressure. More dangerous variants. Guess they can spread easier because the distance between vaxxed is shorter. Igor explain what it means. ""This study looked at two sides of the Moderna Phase 3 vaccine trial: the vaccinated group and the control group. They looked at unvaccinated people having Covid, versus vaccinated people having so called “break-through Covid infections”. Skipping some details, our natural, unvaccinated immunity learns to recognize the “spikes” (S-protein), the “nucleocapsid” (N-Protein) and other pieces of the virus, and develops antibodies and immune memory reacting to all of those. This multifaceted memory also provides broader protection against “variants”. In contrast, vaccination with any existing Covid vaccine, floods our cells with only S-protein (the “spike protein”) from a virus that only existed around January 2020. The difference between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated is FIVE TIMES, which is huge. The unvaccinated are five times more likely than the vaccinated to develop broad immunity including N antibodies. for those vaccinated persons whose breakthrough infection occurred after the second dose, (illness detected on Day 29), their ability to develop N antibodies was 13 TIMES worse than that of the unvaccinated. This inability to obtain broader natural immunity is the reason for endless covids: a covid infection in the vaccinated does not result in lasting immunity and acts similarly to an almost-worthless booster shot. A “breakthrough infection” adds a large number of temporary S-antibodies to the obsolete Wuhan virus. Whereas, the unvaccinated obtain numerous antibodies to all sorts of facets (epitopes) of the virus that infected them."" I´m told ADHD meds will help for VAIDS. Not sure why. Someone suggested because of methylation. Any experts? This link raises concerns about his position and specifically raises conflicts of interest- 'There’s abundant evidence that Vanden Bossche has a not-so-hidden agenda. For example, just before the three-minute mark in the video interview of Vanden Bossche by McMillan, Vanden Bossche indicates he’s a long-time vaccine developer. He adds he’s now focusing on vaccines that “educate the immune system in ways that are to some extent more efficient than we do right now with our conventional vaccines.” Clearly he’s got significant conflicts of interest. Therefore he has zero credibility when it comes to advising the public or anyone else about how to avoid negative effects of mass vaccination.

Other people's jobs are hard too, and in times like this it's important to know what you don't know.' This is from Benedict Evans' (of a16z) blog. I think the second paragraph is especially important in this context - I can think of no better way of putting the point across. Especially true for people taking part in Data Science challenges and pretending to 'help'."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/weve-come-out-of-our-4th-lockdown-anyone-else.6095/,We've come out of our 4th lockdown . . . anyone else?,"Melbourne, a State of Australia has had more lockdowns compared to any other states. Wondering if any other States &/or other Countries are experiencing the same . . . ? In the U.S. lockdowns, have produced a new work mode, i.e.: work from home.   Many folks do not want to return to the daily commute and the office ""nonsense, stupid meetings, and management aggravations"".  The result has been an increase in the sundry non urban housing market and an influx of money, job skills and businesses into suburban areas.  Of course the 2020 summer riots, the increase in criminal activity, lack of law enforcement, and political turmoil hastened the process.   New York City  and other cities are now neither places to visit, nor to live, nor to do business and definitely not places to raise a family for average people. Yes, lockdowns have affected the way we now live . . . unsure if in the long term, it will be better or worse? Yes, I've been taking note of what countries and its numbers. The worst being India and Brazil. You'd hope that it will shed light into a different perspective. Hard to quantify numbers as have 4no. lockdowns of days-weeks cannot really be compared to parts of the UK that have been in a single lockdown for neigh on 300 days for a single stretch. 300 days for a single stretch . . . you must ALL be going through hell In Texas here.  We had a half-lockdown here, in that people were encouraged to work from home if possible and restaurants and bars were very limited capacity for many months.  After roughly (not sure the real number) 6-8 months of bars being shut down and restaurants limited to carry out only,  the restrictions began to ease.  for a couple months restaurants were at 25% capacity, then 50%, etc.  gyms and movie theatres were closed for the same period.   Everything has been back open for several months now and is back to normal.   You still occasionally see someone wearing a mask.  You still find that rare holdout store somewhere that has a sign requiring people to mask up, but people inside that store mostly don't have masks.     I think here in Texas the general attitude is that we are done destroying our lives and economy for a virus whose mortality rate is less than 1%.   My job, in particular is delivering materials to the big hospitals in Houston, and I can tell you that all through the Pandemic it was super creepy walking through a mostly empty building that used to be so busy!!  Very few staff, even fewer patients.  OR empty,  Recovery empty, Intensive Care empty!  It was very strange.  But about the time everything else opened back up, the hospitals have begun to be a bit more busy.  Nothing like pre-covid though.   I never had a day off  and my job can't be done from home, so I was there to see the hospitals empty out and now slowly start to fill back up.   During the middle of the pandemic I could drive the 45 miles from my side of Houston to the far north area (The Woodlands) in 40 minutes!!  Now with traffic back to high levels it takes 1 hour 15 minutes again, depending on time of day.  There are SOME things that I miss about the pandemic (having the streets almost empty)!  It's hard for employers to find employees after the lockdown because some lazy people liked sucking up the government pay to sit at home.  There's STILL a lot of restaurants looking for workers here.   I can't imagine a 300 day lockdown.  I think we would be rioting! Most of Australia are in lockdowns again . . . here in Melbourne, around 75% of office workers are still working from home. It's not back to normal as pre-COVID days . Why are y'all getting locked down again?  Are there not vaccines available now over there?  I'm sorry to be so ignorant of the issues there, but I'd like your perspective rather than what I hear on the news. Here in Australia, regardless of what State you're living in (ie: NSW, VIC, SA etc), the AstraZeneca has caused people to get ""blood clots"". This is a ""known"" side affect which ""some"" people have had a reaction to . . . hence why people are reluctant to get the jab.  Then the ""other"" vaccine is Pfizer which has a high success rate & few side affects . . . there is the problem! Do I blame them? NO! Definitely not. I won't be having the COVID-19 jab regardless of AstraZeneca &/or Pfizer. I have my own personal reasons for this . . . There was and has been a threat of resurgence, so people have not seen a large enough reason to put themselves at that risk.  The government pay is nowhere near enough to drive people to stay home on its own.  If a single point needs to be marked as responsible, blame the antivax/antimask crowd for continuing to devalue human life and encouraging the spread of the virus instead of helping the country become an island of health where people would feel more comfortable with going out and working again. You do have a valid point . . . BUT, then people are complaining of not earning any form of income. It's already starting here Victoria, Australia will be easing restrictions on Friday, 9 July 2021. States such as NSW have gone into further lockdown (harsher restrictions). It's a yo-yo for everyone. As for vaccine side effects, sorry but I can relate to people having concerns. Yes, although it may be rare BUT what happens if you were ""that 1 person"" that it did happen to? How would you feel? Yes, I've heard this on our news reports a couple of days ago . . . well done to the UK I live in Michigan and honestly we only had one lockdown that lasted maybe 6 months.I am sorry for you folks the politicians here have decided there's no advantages of lockdowns The ""unintended consequences"", at least in my part of the NY, of politically motivated lockdowns, vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination/restriction protocols, have been a demand for increased wages, better working conditions, a shortage of workers, the re-location of small/medium sized businesses out of cities, and in general, political and social animosity. ....... All for controlling a laboratory made pandemic virus with a mortality between 1% to 2% on average.  2022 should be an interesting year. Roger on 2022 being an interesting year.  I think the media here in the states, will divert from reporting so much on the virus.  I'm thinking the 2022 story will be inflation.  The media likes to hype the virus, but I believe the inflation will cause much more damage.  And not just economic damage, probably a lot of political damage.  November will be interesting. Another year of flame, blame and shame.  It's quite something to witness. There is a bright spot. If everything goes alright, by June, we should have new IR images from Webb, which should provide a delightful diversion.  And of lot of scientific squabble. I love the explanations. 2022 will also have many space launches for many experiments and programs.  Hundreds, if not thousands of shoe box sats too.  I wonder how many and how long, we can go with all these objects, before we get a collision.  Or possibly a chain collision. We should also get some court decisions for the mandates.  This might help getting back to work.  And we might get more accurate numbers about the virus, and hopefully change some of these current strategies. But, I'm afraid we're about to see some terribly high inflation rates.  And they have not spent all the emergency virus money yet.  Some might even want to ease the coming crunch, with more government emergency handouts. Hang on.   And I have not mentioned foreign affairs.  Much of the world is tied to us. It will be a cluster, for sure. Which developed countries aren't? ... The impact to science could be a bad one indeed further than 2022. The perspective on the covid-19 pandemic seems to be a pervasive fear by governments that the virus will mutate into a variant which has marked increased morbidity and mortality.  It is best to talk candidly with one's health care provider about the virus and taking the vaccine and boosters.  There are adjunct issues, economic, social and political, which are unique to specific nations, and which may have global consequences, e.g.: supply chain trade issues.  IMO, protection of self and family from any untoward effects of the covid-19 virus/variants should be the paramount priority.  The sundry issues of the American political circus as well as that of other nations should be the concerns of those directly involved.  If economic impact issues including inflation and goods shortages are a concern, I recommend ""Basic Economics"" by Thomas Sowell and ""Making Poor Nations Rich"" by. Stanford Economics and Finance which may explain why some Americans figuratively want to ""Brass Knuckle"" some of their politicians. The poor and poorly educated have been hit disproportionately hard with groups demanding more help and support. However, these groups push back on the help and support believing there to be a conspiracy against them.... I would take the news over conspiracy theory sites.... I assume you already have your position regardless?"
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/upcoming-surge-in-deaths-to-rival-or-exceed-last-winter.8277/,Upcoming Surge In Deaths To Rival Or Exceed Last Winter?,"I've created a spreadsheet that appears to accurately predict deaths in the short term based on an estimated 24 day lag time between confirmed cases and deaths. This simple mathematical function indicates that over the course of the next month we could see a peak in deaths that rivals or exceeds the carnage from last year, even in nations with good vaccination rates such as the US and the UK. I'm attaching plots for those nations with traces for the confirmed cases and the actual versus predicted deaths. This is no magic model. It's dirt simple and robust, with no state variables or feedback, and apparently also amazingly accurate. I fine-tuned the lag time by evaluating the match between predicted vs actual deaths by eye. I also added two 'anchors' to better align the lag time to the early pandemic before testing became widespread when people were dying in hospital waiting rooms with zero advance notice of confirmed case. The lag time ramps up linearly from zero to maximum based on those two 'anchors'. I'm attaching two plots each for these two nations, one with the full pandemic time series and another zoomed in from last winter's peak through today. The markers are set to the cases and predicted deaths that apply to today's prediction, so that you can see where we currently are on this trajectory. According to my spreadsheet, this coming carnage is already baked in based upon the confirmed cases to-date. It's as if these people are already dead and just don't know it yet. The principle unknown are how much vaccination and Omicron are improving the case fatality rate in the very short term. It is possible that a dramatic shift in the case fatality rate could perturb the predictive capability of the function. Since it relies upon the lag time of 24 days, there's a 48 day window where abrupt shifts in trends could perturb the result. News reports I've seen don't indicate that either vaccinations or the penetration of Omicron have dramatically changed the outlook in the short term. I'm expecting that this coming surge of deaths is at least partially real, and that my predictive function is keeping up with the trends. Improvement in case fatality rate over the past two years as treatments and vaccines were rolled out don't appear to have dramatically perturbed the historical performance of this predictive function. Delays in testing and reporting seem to be more of a factor, as indicated by abrupt excursions in the US data during/ following  the holidays and also during/following the January 6th insurrection. Recent deaths data in the US and the UK indicate that the uptick in deaths has already begun. This increase is clearly visible in the raw deaths data in my plots, doesn't show up in my symmetrical weighted 13 day running average deaths trace because there's a 6 day processing delay inherent in that averaging function and it's nearly a week behind this uptick. I chose that averaging function because it maximally preserves signal integrity while keeping the averaged trace time-aligned to the raw trace and also maximally flattens the weekly reporting cycle without overly suppressing detail in the traces. This allows the predictive function to closely follow the actual deaths with good fidelity and keeps the plots easily discernible while preserving as much information as possible. I would have posted this data sooner if it was ready. I've been developing this spreadsheet since the beginning of the pandemic and it wasn't until this week that I finally got it working to the level where I felt confident in the results. I haven't seen anything similar anywhere else. The complicated epidemiological models don't provide such an accurate short-term prediction and the one at IHME isn't automatically updating. With my formula, I just download the latest data and the result is instantly available. It doesn't require any tweaking. I'm using the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 cases/deaths time series database and the Our World In Data Covid-19 testing database. There's no mathematical magic and no super genius involved in this spreadsheet. Compared to what epidemiologists routinely do with their modeling, it's trivial.  I'm amazed at how well it works. I wasn't expecting it to conform so closely to reality, but apparently when the pandemic data is good, so is the predictive capability of my spreadsheet. I'll post updates as I improve the spreadsheet with more nations. I haven't added the two 'anchors' for other nations yet and I've recently rewritten the entire spreadsheet from scratch to clarify and simplify it. I'm hoping to eventually add it to GitHub where I'm getting my data from. My first version from nearly two years ago wasn't useful and was poorly received by the experts. Maybe now it's nearly ready for prime time? Here’s the closest I can find online to my predictive formula. The author time-shifted cases to align with deaths. What I’m doing is taking a ratio of that time-aligned cases and deaths data and using that ratio to predict future deaths from current cases. I’m doing the same with the number of tests performed in place of cases. Then I’m averaging the results of the two predictive functions and tweaking the time shift for optimal alignment. I think 21 days is too short. I think the actual lag is closer to 24 based on my results. I also think my method is more useful because it automatically scales itself over time with no user intervention required. So after starting this thread I noticed two things. First, apparently cases in the UK may have already peaked (plainly visible in my plots above) and the predicted deaths aren't nearly what they were last winter, only 1/4, according to my function.. Second, I just heard on KQED that 98% of cases in the US are Omicron as of today and none of the patients have required ventilators, plus the rise in cases in the US recently is so steep as to potentially upset the accuracy of my predictive function. Maybe it's not as bad as it looks at first glance. We'll just have to wait and see... Meanwhile, the page that drew my attention to KQED is one indicating a dramatic decrease in US lifespan that is attributed principally to Covid-19. Data Dog, I have a question.  How much faith do you have in the data that you are using? Well science isn’tabout faith. The stats in the US and UK are known good, comparatively. Stats from Russia, India, etc are known to be less comprehensive. The fact that it is possible to apply my simple formula and achieve good correlation between cases and deaths indicates at a minimum that errors are at least systematic rather than random. I’ve been consideringIHME data too. They are further along in the analysis and modeling, and they publish plots with traces that are based on reported stats and ‘actual’ numbers that are estimated from test positivity, orders for caskets and urns, etc. Final stats on disease always include adjustments for known inadequacies in reported cases and deaths. IHME is making these adjustments in real time to correct errors that perturb their models. It may prove beneficial for my formula too or at least make the magnitude more a reflection of reality. The truth is that these numbers are always lacking and that’s why epidemiologists include wide margins of error in their final estimates, regardless of what aspect of health they are reporting on. Numbers are better than ever with computers and Internet so we probably have a far better grasp of facts today than we did 25 or 50 or 100 years ago. The rapid increase in cases and the plunging Case Fatality Rate of Omicron upset the accuracy of the extrapolating prediction function I was using and the result was a significant exaggeration of the predicted deaths in the short term. I changed the function to use either cases, testing, or both for the prediction, depending on which one produced the most accurate prediction. The basis for the prediction is carried forward in the most recent portion of the trace where the confirmed deaths have not yet occurred for the most recently confirmed cases. The output of the function is more noisy in the recent past but it aligns better with the actual deaths and likely is a better short-term prediction: The raw deaths data (ragged pink trace) indicates that the US has passed the peak deaths and is on the way down. The extrapolated prediction of future deaths (red trace) concurs. The US extrapolated predicted deaths trace seems to indicate that the current peak is likely to top out at 75% of last winter's peak. However, that's not the full story, because events abroad indicate more trouble is coming our way. The UK is experiencing a resurgence due to a new Omicron subvariant: Researchers have established the existence of three sublineages of Omicron. The 'standard' sublineage is now referred to as BA.1/B.1.1.529.1, and the two other sublineages are known as BA.2/B.1.1.529.2 and BA.3/B.1.1.529.3. They share many mutations, but also significantly differ. BA.1 and BA.2 share 32 mutations, but differ by 28. This makes them as different as some other major variants, and it has been suggested that BA.2 should receive its own name based on the Greek alphabet. "" The increase in confirmed cases is the most abrupt yet. The UK has not yet seen the peak in deaths from this new Omicron subvariant, but the extrapolated prediction indicates it will be more severe than the prior peak from the original Omicron variant by perhaps 40%: That new Omicron subvariant could cause deaths per 100K in the UK to exceed the US in the short term, according to my revised extrapolating prediction function: A significant factor in this predicted reversal of deaths per 100K  is the Case Fatality Rate in the US reaching parity with the UK recently: The parity in CFR could be due to a recent uptick in the number of people getting their first vaccine dose. This is the only vaccination metric in the US that recently achieved parity with the UK: Perhaps the most significant factor in surviving the oncoming Omicron subvariant is how recently a person was vaccinated? If so, that means booster doses are critical to saving life as vaccine immunity rapidly fades. Or maybe the simple act of getting that first jab is the most important factor in surviving the new Omicron subvariant? Another factor in the reversal of predicted deaths per 100K is the cases per 100K in the UK recently exceeding the US. With more cases, deaths will likely increase too: When that Omicron subvariant saturates the US, it could cause a lot of damage. ""While there is currently no evidence that the BA.2 lineage is more severe than the BA.1 lineage, experts have warned that BA.2 could extend the current wave of COVID-19 infections in the U.S."" If that new peak in deaths due to the Omicron subvariant in the US also becomes 40% higher than the most recent Omicron peak, the deaths/day/100K could exceed last winter's peak, topping out near 1.08 this winter: vs 1.00 last winter: It looks as if my original prediction of Omicron deaths meeting or exceeding last winter's peak is on track, despite the exaggeration in the original function. The situation is not as bad as it first appeared, but it's still bad. I'll post another update after the Omicron subvariant does its damage to document how well my prediction tracked reality. I think the most salient factor in this analysis is the recent plunge in Case Fatality Rate. The degree of penetration of new vaccines combined with lower lethality of new variants are the two things that our public health officials said would happen as life gets 'back to normal'. It appears that we are well on our way and that's a good sign, despite the high number of deaths. Meanwhile in other news some Democratic governors are relaxing mask mandates this month. I guess they agree that things are getting 'back to normal'. Hopefully new variants are even less lethal and Covid-19 becomes just another common cold soon. Thanks for reading. As of February 4, IHME modeling and simulation still doesn't indicate a resurgence in US deaths from the Omicron subvariant that is making the rounds in the UK: There is a lot more expertise behind their work, however, they have been consistently conservative in their modeling. I'm not sure how well I trust their short-term predictions compared to mine. They don't have the most recent peak in UK cases in their simulation yet either. Their modeling lags reality significantly: The advantage of my simplistic function is that it provides immediate results. I guess we will see who is right. My simplistic extrapolation doesn't indicate a resurgence in the US either because the new Omicron subvariant isn't yet represented in the cases, but that won't stop me from speculating based on what my extrapolation portends for the UK. EDIT: It appears that I was mistaken about the Omicron subvariant. The UK has reverted to BA.1 so it's a resurgence of the original: Quotes from your posts in this thread include: "" I've created a spreadsheet that appears to accurately predict deaths"" ""plunging Case Fatality Rate of Omicron upset the accuracy of the extrapolating prediction function I was using and the result was a significant exaggeration"" ""The situation is not as bad as it first appeared, but it's still bad."" Don't forget that countries [science] report predictions to allow governments to implement actions... If deaths start to rise unexplained, the prediction will show an ever increasing curve and government will make a change e.g. lockdowns. Your position is based on historical figures and will typically predict what would happen had government not taken action but will be along the lines of what science had previously reported. In a simple format, what do you predict the USA weekly average (cases/ deaths reported) to be (assuming the week ends Fridays) for the following. I have made my estimate too for the craic. 18Feb22  165000 (1900) 25Feb22   145000 (1650) 04Mar22   110000 (1650) 11Mar22  70000 (1500) Looking at the link below, the peak in deaths was significantly less than the previous Winter peak. As your post was 12 January 2022 (reporting significantly less deaths than 12 January 2021) , how was your model reporting incorrectly after an hour? I agree with you! I don't think faith and trust mean much any more.  The last several years have demonstrated a complete lack of any standards.  It's been one lie after another.  And I don't think covid is the only thing they have been lying about. They make up false threats, to give them power and purpose.  These are very empty people. In your opinion and not from a scientific origin? I currently have reservations about Data Dog's methodology as they seem to report after-the-fact. ""In your opinion and not from a scientific    origin?"" It's from a long lost concept my parents first taught me.  Then from    my teachers, college and university professors.  It use to be called    the primary purpose of education, but now is referred to as    conspiracy theories. We called it free critical thinking and expression.  But not taught    or practiced for decades. Cloning dogma seems to be the purpose now. Anyhow, that's where it comes from.  When you see decade after    decade of false and fake agendas and policies, their not too hard to    spot. I would day it is a human behavioural science... When a claim is made, you would hope that if people are able to evaluate it as false in the future that they would be able to evaluate it the present. Whilst human behaviour is so driven by financial gain, then the cycle of distrust will continue... You;ll have to excuse me as I am from the UK so I may not be accurate in my facts, but the principle is my main point. The pledge of building a wall between America and Mexico at the expense of Mexico. The border is around 2000 miles... Can it be said that he broke his promise or would it be reasonable to consider that it wouldn't be a realistic aim  to achieve in 3.5 years unless more essential parts of America were to suffer such as infrastructure. Believing that Mexico would pay up money to pay for the wall should really sound alarm bells.... I would hope people would consider that America would be appointing and managing the contractors and expecting Mexico to agree for errors, mismanagement etc... People believe what they want to hear and disregard the claims of what is realistic... The people behind the main person see the popularity and support it further with the hope of implementing at least some realistic changes and hoping the public support doesn't wain. In the UK (and other countries) there has been a big push for Green Policy to be implemented and changes on emissions etc..., however the vote for the parties that would implement this is typically less than the people protesting. The joys of behavioural science. Yes human behavior is perplexing.  I disagree with every statement you made about it. You disagree people vote for what benefits them and believe they are victims of unrealistic promises. I disagree with your comprehension of human behavior and motive, and therefore your comprehension of human endeavors.  I comprehend existence in this reality, in a different fashion than you do. Ok... I was trying to make it scientific to keep within the forum rules, but... ""When you see decade after decade of false and fake agendas and policies, their not too hard to spot. "" Why do you Americans keep promoting and ultimately putting people in power with fake agendas and policies? Are the population unable to identify this or are these the best people available for the role? It's a matter of comprehension.  It's the information YOU select, and the way you put all of it together in your mind. Comprehension is unique to every person.  It's what makes you, you. So, what is a danger to you, is a blessing for me.  For instance.  With all the information I can gather, the increase in CO2, without the predicted temperature rise, shows me that global warming is a blessing, not a threat. And that science is wrong about earth's environment. From what I find, this earth has been starving for CO2 for millions of years. Some even believe the information from the media or academia to comprehend and form their opinions and judgements.   I trust neither. It might be from being raised in the country setting, we learned to recognize manure, at an early age. It is this part that I am curious on though... A Government has a policy of increase CO2 emissions, irrespective of whether you voted for this Government or not... WOuld your position be it was a false/ fake agenda and the other points you made... There are a multitude of reasons why a promise can't happen.... I could promise the family a dream holiday 10k miles away for 2023 but if I am made redundant and lose my income or if a new Covid variant means flights into the country from my home country are banned etc... Then I would have failed in my promise. In 2022 with the information I have available, my promise was sound and to plan for every potential risk would mean you ground to a halt. I believe (within reason) all pledges, promises etc... I make a personal evaluation how likely they can be met and which ones our less likely to occur if an 'unknown' occurs. My position is based on how helpful something will be to me and friends/ family (current/ future) and the likelihood it can be sufficiently achieved in a term. Many changes are incredibly small and certainly take generations to come in... Not long ago an advert was working its way round social media along the lines of stop and think... Should you have that 5th beer and drive? This was the mid-70s. To instantly go from no limit to where we are now would have caused a huge uproar... When I started work, a lunch beer was acceotable... Now alcohol consumption on an Evening is evaluated if you are set to drive the next morning... It has taken 50 years to that stage. We have differing views and I respect that, but I am not questioning whom is right or wrong here. We have never had another choice or option.  Whatever the future brings we must adapt.  Suicide excluded.  I can't find any validity to this climate response.  If all the west, stopped all the CO2 emissions from energy production, this very hour, the CO2 will still rise far above any measured values.  It can not be stopped.  China and India alone, will put more CO2 into the air than mankind has ever seen.  If you think the coal haze of the early 1900s western industries was bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. I disagree with your comprehension of human behavior and motive, and therefore your comprehension of human endeavors."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/12-coronavirus-myths-busted-by-science.1091/,12 Coronavirus myths busted by science,"There's plenty of nonsense about the coronavirus online. Here are some of the biggest COVID-19 myths out there and the science to explain why they aren't true. Regarding #2 "" Not necessarily. "" I disagree with the way this is said. At least in most places, you ARE way more likely to get the flu. Although the coronavirus has a higher R0, it is not circulating widely in the United States and most countries. And not only is the flu potentially deadly, illness can last a very long time and cause disability and interruption of your life/career. So people should be taking the flu seriously and get a flu shot. Especially since it could be devastating to get both viruses at the same time. To correct you a dog has tested positive in the last week of one of the infecteds owners. So you might want to correct that. Misinformation is bad. How would anyone know ? They have tested 14,000 people in S Korea in one day, and yet to date the US has only 450 testing kits.By the time they do get enough kits how far will it have spread ?? Ridiculous statement !! Fun Fact the Flu and Coronavirus can be confused for each other as they have almost identical symptoms the only true distinguishing factor is the horrendous forms viral pneumonia that they both cause but by then you are already hospitalized. GG China won. Where did you get this lovely 450 testing kits btw? Do you even know how the medical field tests this virus? Lmao it's more about how many they have processed as testing is easy just long as to the way they do it which has about a 3 day turn around even in a rush with RNA testing. That's a saliva or blood test send off to CDC. The viral pneumonia it causes is so unique that the can actually diagnose you faster if it's at that stage with a simple x-ray. The article says: ”Previous research has found that coronaviruses don't survive long on objects such as letters and packages.” But viruses, according to many scholarly definitions, are organisms that replicate inside living cells. A non-living organism can’t be killed., though they can be stopped from replicating. That’s part of the problem with viruses and why the diseases they cause can’t easily be treated..  It’s a completey different process from killing a  bacterial infection. Bacteria are living organisms that can be killed.. As example,  tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria. Small pox, measles, mumps, chicken pox, herpes, AIDS, and shingles are some diseases that are caused by [non-living] viruses. Viral diseases are difficult or impossible to treat effectively. They can be prevented, however, by a vaccine. ” made out of cells, they can't keep themselves in a stable state, they don't grow, and they can't make their own energy. Even though they definitely replicate and adapt to their environment, are more like androids than real .” ” Firstly, 9 days is still a hell of a long time. Secondly, if you know of bacteriophages then you know viruses can survive longer on inanimate objects if bacteria is on them. Considering the wide range of bacteria in the very air around us at any given time good and bad they could feed and live a lot longer in the right conditions. There are viral robots that eat bacteria. But again they are biological machines. Therefore they are very much alive. Until they aren't. Khanacademy is okay but I wouldn't put that much stock in a link from them as my proof. If this report is correct, then why is there under 3,00 deaths from SARS2 and over 79,000 from flu world wide figures? The infection RO is still holding at 2.2 that means around 1 - 4 people can be infected from each person with the virus. The main reason for all this hype and news about SARS 2 is, it has an incubation period of up to 14 days, where the flu shows within 24 hours. Why no ""Warnings"" about the way the flu has killed and infected many more people that this virus? Even with a vaccine for flu, no vaccine for SARS 2 Yet, as testing has only just started earlier this week? How about this from or this from : “Viruses are not living things. Viruses are complicated assemblies of molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates, but on their own they can do nothing until they enter a living cell. Without cells, viruses would not be able to multiply. Therefore, viruses are not living things.” You used something from 2004 and a duality argument paper in which scientists argue both sides. Bacteriophages exist in the air and water around the world, in your body and on all organic surfaces. These papers only prove the point they are alive and without a host they would die. Much like a bacterial seed or a parasite. Just because it is parasitic in nature doesn't mean it's not alive. There is a spark of life once certain conditions are met. When a sperm and egg meet life starts. Much like organics and a virus. To say a sperm or an egg would also be incorrect. I love wherever you got your degree. I will assume it is stamped by Google. Or better yet Khan Academy. Here is something more recent stay woke my friend. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 You are more likely to get a flu so far because this new virus has not yet become widespread. However, the R0 of the Coronavirus is almost twice as high as of the seasonal flu (plus there are no vaccines for it), so it definitely has a higher transmissibility rate. If it becomes as widespread as a seasonal flu, it will be twice  “easier” to catch it than to catch a seasonal flu. Kudos to the editors for this well-balanced, fact-based article, which seeks to put the COVID-19 outbreak in perspective and blunt the growing hysteria. I live in Asia, where the panic is even greater, fueled by nonstop coverage of the budding ""plague"" on television and online. While, of course, precautions are certainly necessary, people should remember, as this article states, that even in the unlikely event that a person contracts the virus, it's far from a death sentence. What strikes me is that people who think nothing of driving recklessly or otherwise putting their health at risk from a poor diet, smoking or drugs, nonetheless are panicking over this virus. But viruses, according to many scholarly definitions, are organisms that replicate inside living cells. A non-living organism can’t be killed., though they can be stopped from replicating. That’s part of the problem with viruses and why the diseases they cause can’t easily be treated..  It’s a completey different process from killing a  bacterial infection. Bacteria are living organisms that can be killed.. As example,  tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria. Small pox, measles, mumps, chicken pox, herpes, AIDS, and shingles are some diseases that are caused by [non-living] viruses. Viral diseases are difficult or impossible to treat effectively. They can be prevented, however, by a vaccine. [/QUOTE] This is a case where biologists are incorrect. The main criterion for a living organism ought to be that it shows an autonomous purposeful behavior. Since orthodox science rules out teleology from the start, it can't accurately distinguish living organisms from non-living entities. But the behavior of viruses only makes sense if they're regarded as living organisms. They are parasitic, true, but they do reproduce after their own fashion. For that matter, human beings are not self reproducing but required a cooperate effort. All of which just points up one of the great shortcomings of contemporary science....

[/QUOTE] I like this backup Haha I find it hilarious in under a decade we now have some studies revealing and admitting they are living organisms while some of the less informed or who learned back when them just being not alive was true for that was as far as our science understood. I mean just look at vaccines you have live virus and dead virus bases. Misleading but true. If something can live by replicating it simply is alive. It's like saying when a non alive thing goes active it is a zombie. A dead thing that came alive. If a virus can die it had to have lived. Very pinnacle of life and death and how one must always have the other as a codependent. Her statement is currently correct. We have estimates on how many people are infected with influenza based on past seasons. COVID-19 may be under reported, but there's sufficient information to know there are not 10s of millions of americans running around with it (yet). Article says: ""No evidence suggests that the virus is man-made."" Actually, yes, there is evidence to suggest the virus is man made. The evidence is conviniently placed on page two of Google's search list. It is a cheap trick to use the term ""science"" as rhetoric to convey 'authority' and manipulate people's thinking. Consider the statement, ""there is no evidence to support the theory of evolution--evolution debunked by science!""  Obviously, there definitely is evidence to support the theory of evolution.  But to take a negative position on the subject requires absolutely no work on the writers part, whereas the positive position demands production of evidence that you deny--evidence that may be hidden on page two of Googles search results. ""At a on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) hosted by the Taiwan Public Health Association at NTU, Fang Chi-tai , a professor at NTU's College of Public Health, addressed the many theories circulating that the virus somehow leaked... The professor said that viruses normally only have small mutations in the form of singular changes in natural conditions. He asserted that in nature, it is 'unlikely to have four amino acids added at once.' Fang concluded, ""Therefore, from an academic point of view, it is indeed possible that the amino acids were added to COVID-19 in the lab by humans."" He said that it is also still possible that this occurred in nature but that ""the chances are very slim."" PLEASE stfu, wtf are u even talking about. It doesnt matter if you get a flu or COVID-19, you will be in critial if not severe condition if not treated properly - comparison is just bs. Don't just state that you should get a flu jab instead. We are talking about the likeliness of getting this virus. People should/already have taking flu jabs if they are travelling and/or during some point in their lives; if not, they will be in the same situation as getting COVID-19. You cannot say ""it is not circulating widely in the United States and most countries"" - how would YOU know that? Are you travelling all across the world to to find out? news? ridiculous. There are many unconfirmed cases that even the WHO organisation realises. Even though many countries ""contain"" and ""screen"" travellers incoming from foreign land, it does not mean people cannot bypass checks and hide them. Moreover, some cases are hard to distingush if they are infected or not. This is because the COVID-19 has similar characteristics to the SARS and MERS (they can live on surfaces and has better survival in cold temperatures). People might get pass screen by blood and fluids tests BUT since the virus can live for more than 24hrs (according the similar characteristics), it is likely to linger on the clothes and travelling necessities and luggage - MAYBE (i hope not but its likely) that people, when unpacking, come in contact with the surfaces and become infected. Although coming in contact with hands are not likely to truly become infected, the activities afterwards might - e.g. eating, touching face, etc. Do YOU get my point now? It's not easy hearing these news and also knowing these kinds of things happening around the world. But please PLEASE THINK before stating something that is so unthoughtful. My late mother in law was a world pioneer in the ""orign of life""   One of the things she noted routinely was that there was or a sperm cell?   Life is a complex matrix of functionality.  what matters is which function you are looking at. Second the endless comparisons to influenza are simply irrelevant to this problem.   The average incubation period for flu is two days, which makes it a totally different (but real) public health problem .  Aysympotaomatic transmission has never been shown Asymptomatic transmission is what makes a low transmission disease into a pandemic  in a modern trave environment.     That is why this disease is so scary. is it in Minnesota i'm Kind of Worried. The part about not catching it at a Chinese restaurant is very misleading and makes out that such a claim is racist. A few weeks ago virtually all the known cases were in China and this was also the Chinese New Year when many Chinese living outside China will have visited friends and family in China. It was therefore statistically more likely that a person of Chinese apearance in the USA (or anywhere) would have the virus and indeed the first cases outside China were people who had been there. My own view is the risk was still so small it simply wasn't worth worrying about and I had two Chinese takeaways in that period here in the UK. That doesn't stop the risk being slightly higher though.  Things have clearly changed now and the virus believes in equality so it is increasingly less valid to avoid Chinese restaurants. Regarding #2 "" Not necessarily. "" When I read things like this I have little faith in the person who wrote it. The words ""less likely"" refers to probability. If I have 1% chance of catching flu in March then I have less than 1% of catching the virus. Using the term ""not necessarily"" as a reply is completely nonsensical since it too is a probability. So it's like saying I have a 25% chance of having less than 1% chance of catching it. Puzzled by the statement that face masks do not help prevent one catching the virus. If they catch droplets from a carrier then they are preventing the droplets from reaching other people. That the masks do not filter out virus sized particles is not relevant - there is no evidence that carriers  exhale free virus particles, but plenty that the are contained in droplets and that these droplets may be inhaled by others as well as landing on surfaces. Close proximity is a big problem. Masks work.  Article says masks won't stop the virus, but then says masks will stop sick people from spreading the virus to others.  Just pretend the sick person's mask is on your face and that the mask is stopping droplets from the sick person from reaching you.  See, masks work.  Maybe not perfectly, or as much as people would hope, but they work. Its estimated that the corona virus will have infected Northern America. This is because patients infected with Covid-19 are almost always completely asymptomatic in the early stages. They are still capable of transmitting the disease... even in the very early stages of contamination when they may truly have no reason to believe they are carrying the virus. It is transmitted by being exposed to any expelled liquids originating from a sick or carrying human's mucus membrane. Its said to last up until 9 days outside of a carrier... Which is unbelievably resilient and alarming. It was stated that California was only rationed 450 Covid-19 testing kits...Which seemed hopeless and utterly laughable considering scientists proclaimed it was almost guaranteed that Covid-19's true northern american ground zero.... Had actually hit the ground running... More importantly it had the potential to run like a enraged bull tearing through a ceaseless supply of red barn walls (representing potential unsuspecting carriers)Just like the bull bulldozing through those walls the Covid-19 virus was given a head start, with no known vaccine, no absolute test to guarantee who is infected, has a cloaked appearance, and a much higher mortality probability  than Influenza already carries. It was unleashed with all those alarming advantages for infecting a sparsely populated area...Let alone a very densely populated Californian coast....And this started  4-6 weeks previous of the first patient who tested positive for the Wuhan Corona Virus in America.  All of North America were  lacking proper governmental preparation, guidance, and leadership. Just thinking about those likely to be fatally affected by this virus opened my eyes wide.... knowing my parents are in their 80's....Subsequently I may only have one year or so left to experience their profound stockpiles of knowledge, unyielding work ethic, and most importantly their unyielding outpouring of love and kindness along with the truly defining lack of care that they express about their wrinkles, scars, and trials and tribulations that truly highlight their amazing spirits coupled  with unbelievable amount of inner peace .... Only obtained by knowing they not only survived their scars and wrinkles... But the fact they did so holding onto ideals, sayings,  and beliefs all belonging under the same loving umbrella that  give their souls credence by never giving up on the actions and beliefs they hold onto dearly every day ...which makes the commonly practiced younger generations habit of blowing every way the wind goes and never standing for anything at all....In the end  so worthless just the same as a smooth sea never made a skillful sailor. The tendency to  avoid experiencing all turmoil and strife will in no doubt leave a pretty road paved, perfectly glimmering with gold bricks...But roads are meant to be sturdy... Not pretty.  A word to the wise at the same time... The road to hell is paved with the best intentions...and paved by the engineer with the least learned lessons"
