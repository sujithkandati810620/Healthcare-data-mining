Commonly used antiviral medication (e.g., acyclovir and ganciclovir) inhibit DNA polymerases. Identifying substances with viral targets other than DNA polymerases are of particular interest to avoid resistance.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-coronavirus.1121/,What Are the Symptoms of the Coronavirus?,"With all the talk of the coronavirus, you’re probably monitoring every cough, sneeze, or mild cold just in case it turns into a deadly illness. Of course, without knowing the exact symptoms of coronavirus, you won’t be able to distinguish it from other illnesses. It doesn’t exactly announce itself with a nametag. As the virus spreads from country to country, it’s important to know how to spot the symptoms both in yourself and in those close to you. Here’s a look at the symptoms of the coronavirus. Coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so the symptoms will mostly affect your respiratory system. Coughing and shortness of breath are the most common, and a fever will generally accompany these. Don’t panic if you have these symptoms though, because they can apply to other illnesses as well. When monitoring symptoms, keep in mind the time frame that they appear within. If you suspect you’ve been exposed to someone who could have the virus, symptoms can appear between 2 and 14 days afterward. For comparison, influenza symptoms are usually apparent 1-4 days after exposure. The longer incubation time might help coronavirus spread, since those who are infected don’t know they are yet and can still be contagious even without symptoms. One challenge when diagnosing coronavirus is that its symptoms are very close to the flu. Both are respiratory illnesses, and both can cause fever and shortness of breath. So, if you have flu-like symptoms, it’s wise to stay home, avoid contact with others, and work on getting better with rest, hydration, and fever-reducing medication. Keep in mind that about 80% of coronavirus cases have been mild. Even if you do get it, chances are, you’re going to be fine. The virus sounds a bit like ""the big pretender"",  while you might think you have flu, or a cold, you could actually have this new virus. Or you may not have any serious symptoms.  While always being fastidious with hand washing, I am a nurse, I am shocked by people who wear masks (which are said to do very little) but don't wash their hands. Please wear rubber gloves when going out. I sincerely wish everyone could see what is growing on hands under a microscope. It is enough to make you sick, pardon the pun people.  I hope scientists find a vaccine and huge quantities are made so many can be inocculated. Hang in there folks, this too shall pass, probably not as fast as we would like it to. A little bit of misinformation in the OP.  The cough for COVID-19 is a dry cough. But that could later develop into a wet cough later on, so if you're a natural cougher anyway (eg smoker) then you might miss the initial symptom. Because my symptoms weren't severe enough, I was not able to get a test to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19.  But I know that I had it because I've never experienced shortness of breath in my life like I did for this.  I also never experienced the tingling and itchiness deep in my lungs, and the dry cough.  I've had the flu before and never experienced anything similar. I'm attributing 10,000 miles of bicycle exercise over 4 years to my ability as a 53 yo to recover from COVID-19 without any hospitalization or medication.  But I did experience all three of the main symptoms.  The dry cough is the longest lasting ~ 30 days and counting. Yes, it is fever, dry cough...hard breathing Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea Look for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately: Trouble breathing Persistent pain or pressure in the chest New confusion Inability to wake or stay awake Bluish lips or face My symptoms were 1. Wednesday sweat profusely at 1 PM for one half hour with no other symptons 2. Thursday, severe stomach pain after lunch took off the next day 3. Woke up Friday with no symptoms then developed severe diarrhea later as the stomach issue passed 4. Saturday no symptoms until dinner which had absolutely no taste The wife lost much of her hearing for 4 or 5 days and our son threw up in the gym.  No medical attention was needed, the common cold is way more frustrating Our household got this virus in mid July. We are in Souther California high desert, in East Kern County (geographical reference) We are three in the household, no pre existing conditions we are in mid 40’s my Son 17, just turned 18, shortly after contracting the virus. Our symptoms were different, but the one thing we all experienced was losing our sense of taste and smell. The strange thing is, my Son and Husband had that symptom around 1 week before I did. Which is odd because I share the same sleeping quarters as my husband, and my son is always in a different part of our home. But after analyzing the entire process, from which we became aware, to testing to recovery, etc. The explanation of our lapse in becoming infected, was in theory, that week I worked nights, and was gone from around 5pm - 2am, so they had dinner (take out) and delivery etc., while on most instances we have dinner as a unit. But also, by the time I got in everyone was already in bed and. or asleep. The first time my Son said he recalled losing his sense of smelling anything was on a Friday, but he didn’t think anything of at the time. He mentioned it to me (via-text) the Monday after, he experienced this for around 3 days. On that the same day, later on my husband told me the same thing, which was he couldn’t taste anything! I told him: Tim said he couldn’t taste or smell any thing either... I looked at him and I said oh no! Maybe it’s coronavirus!? I went and talked to my Son asking him, what other symptoms he had. He told me that he haven’t been feeling that good all weekend, and just been tired. Which I did notice because he was going to sleep earlier than usual, being that he spends most of the nights very late on his PS4 gaming. That weekend he was asleep by the time I got home. My husband was sick Friday but went to work, and felt very out of it all weekend, and on that Monday I was feeling out of it, but went to work and I felt very tired, and I remember not having any desire to eat, on my break, which is very unusual. I also remember having very bad stomach pains, and was so tired that I was just counting the minutes to go home and felt like laying down the whole night. I yawned and was very out of it, by the end of my 8 hour shift... When I got home finally is when we all realized that this could be the virus,  which we all tried so hard to protect ourselves against, with constantly washing and sanitizing, I had disinfected every thing the best I could, used alcohol swabs everywhere I went, wiped my steering wheel shifters, keys, phone door handles light switches and everything we brought in from the store, or from the outside. We social disgraced like we possibly ever could. We went nowhere! Except work, and the market if needed only! I wouldn’t allow guests over, everything was on pause, and we followed all public officials guidance. But, the week I leave  the men to fen for themselves... Sh*t hit the fan, and it went everywhere! My Son and husband went to pick up pizza, from the local pizza place, while I was at work. My Son always took his mask everywhere, and wore it while in public, when we went to the market, gas station, etc. But that night he ran in to grab the pizza, and he forgot to bring his mask, but he figured, ah, no biggie, the counter is like 4 feet from the entrance and it will be quick. Well, mind you, nobody in that pizza place wears masks, still don’t from the last I checked, and that’s the only place we can think of where this Virus must of been contracted from. This was mid week of that Friday, my son first became aware of any symptom. By the time we figured it out I had already been to work a few nights, but that Monday I noticed a difference in my physical abilities. Tuesday I called work and explained what was going on, and that Thursday I got tested. My husband also called out, which he called out that Monday, and was in bed for the next two and a half weeks. He experienced a very sharp pain on the top of his skull, in the top, slightly to the left of his head, he was in agonizing pain for at least 10 days straight and any pain reliever he took, did no justice. He hardly ate, he felt pretty warm to hot, for a good 5-7 days, which he may have experienced a fever, but with a thermometer, I couldn’t say for sure. I personally don’t know if I ever had a temperature, however we are supposed to check our temps before every shift, nobody ever really does, but we are required to wear masks, no exceptions! This in fact is my true analysis, and conclusion, that masks 100% work, to slow or stop the spread. Had I or my coworkers not been wearing them, they all would of contracted this virus. Not one of them did!!! We worked 8 hours very close in proximity and I was experiencing full on symptoms that last night I worked. Moreover, had my son wore a mask upon going into that pizza place for only a couple minutes, he would of never been exposed! He hadn’t gone anywhere else that week, but there, or without coverings, otherwise. But from that moment forward we were all very out of it and very tired, far more than I could ever explain. My husband didn’t go get tested that day I went because he could barely lift his head, to get out of bed. My son wanted to go get tested, but their policy only aloud ages 18 and over to be tested, which in my opinion makes it clear, why the numbers of 17 and younger, infected people were very low. They only tested younger people if they went in to the ER with similar symptoms, or if they were referred by their primary physician. But anyway, the next several weeks were sluggish, house started piling up, lawn wasn’t getting watered, etc... It took 8 days to get my POSITIVE for COVID-19 results and it was official. After the long drawn out next couple weeks passed, my symptoms turned into a whole different issue, while my husband was feeling better, I started to get strange pressure in my chest. It would feel very heavy and I felt like it would stop me in my tracks. Or keep me numb for around 10-15 minutes at a time. If I sat up, lay down, turn over, or laid on my side, either side, it would just feel like extreme pressure in my chest. This happened a few times a day. I honestly thought I was probably going to die. That went from chest tightness, to just feeling like someone was squeezing my heart. To this day, I have experienced this almost daily. Although it’s a little more milder than it was before, I still fell it. My Son also told me he gets the same thing in his chest, but he describes it as not as intense as myself. Recently my Daughter, who lives near by, who’s 20, has told me that she’s been experiencing those same symptoms, and just a few days ago, my Son while visiting said her two roommates also were saying they are getting unusual chest symptoms. I told my Daughter they should go get the anti-bodies test, because they probably got the virus and don’t know. Because during that time we were infected, in fact that Monday we realized what it might be, I gave her a ride to meet her grandparents because they were going to Vegas for the night, and she went with them. Neither of us wore masks while riding in my car, and I am 100% certain I was infected that day, which was also the last night I went to work. We finally went back the 3rd week of August, after we took an anti-bodies test, which also confirmed my husbands positive Covid infection, which his work wanted him to present documentation for, amid his 5-6 weeks out. But the experience was a little surreal. QUICK NOTE: Not one of us experienced a cough, shortness of breath, and from self observation, only my Husband experienced a fever... And finally; We did everything possible to avoid getting this virus, and until these heart symptoms finally go away completely, in hopes of being out of the woods, from possibly sealing my fate, I’m sort of relieved otherwise, in having contracted this virus. I feel less stressed, in going out there, and becoming infected, and not knowing what to expect, because everyone’s different and will have different symptoms, experiences, and, or end results. You could die, and that’s the scary part. You can pass it on to others who can die, or who knows it could leave lasting health issues, that you never had prior to. I’m still planning on going to get a full check up, but I haven’t yet. Further complications, are yet, to be determined. Just an insight of what you may expect, if you become infected.

For example, if you responded asymptomatically on a first infection, will you respond asymptomatically if you contract the virus a second or even third time? I would think that its hard to say with certainty, but generally, secondary and subsequent infections of the same virus appear milder than the primary/initial infection as the body has some experience with the virus and should be able to deal with it quicker. Somebody who was asymptomatic first time around may still have immune memory for reinfections even in spite of lower antibody production, but whether or not this would mean another asymptomatic presentation is hard to know. I would imagine that the viral load exposed to, age and general state of health & immune system would all be factors. No, it may not be. When Covid began to spread rapidly and first jumped from one country to the next, I began tracking the news by symptoms, people affected, and symptoms. The reason COVID is called a Novel virus is because WHO has not seen one like it.  People tested were showing up with muting strains from the time it was discovered in the first person who showed the Sars-Covid strain together, and as it progressed,  other strains were seen, as well as, the rapid changes in symptoms.  If I recall the estimated different strains were nine (9) but  I did not hear the confirmation. When different strains are seen in a muting, Novel virus with different symptoms, I think it is safe to say one may indeed get a second infection if a mutation comes around. The progression went from middle aged, to older people, then pre-adolescent and children, and this week 12 infants, one has died was rapid, and there still is not enough information as to what degree of underlying damage may occur AFTER the person is out of immediate danger. The first indication of this was lung damage after respiratory distress and needing a Ventilator. Later, healthcare saw children get sick and go home, only to return and find internal organ damage when there were no signs during the illness. We are in uncharted waters here;  take every precaution and follow the World Health Organization  for warnings, updates, and what is happening with testing and vaccine.  The UK has one being used on volunteer patients which is showing great promise from Astra-Zineca.  Never think you are safe.  Your well-being depends on those around you. I made a meme for the news of July 23.  Think about 2-weeks (?) ago, seeing all the people at the beaches  along the coast of America.  This is the result  of a weeks worth of beachtime without masks, but some did have distancing.  Still, numbers don't lie.    1 million new U.S. infections in 15 days.   Respect this virus. ,"

Anecdotal slim evidence, I used 300 mg of Lactoferrin with 11 mg of zinc four times a day for four days.  I had come down with what seamed a strange illness on March 2nd.  I had a little sore throat with bad body aches and fever, which was followed by a dry cough. I started the treatment as soon as I got the throat symptoms, within two days the aches and fever were gone and the cough lasted another 3 days. Hi, there. We discourage discussing any actual treatment options or methods without consulting with a medical professional. In many cases, I find that I can do a better job myself than a medical professional. I have cured myself of life-threatening infections with non-allopathic methods. The doctors had no definite solutions.  In one case I told my doctor how I cured it. That doctor now tells patients to use that method. Here are some examples of success: Probiotic to cure deadly C-defile infection Olive oil in the ear to cure a life-threatening infection. Mullein tea to cure persistent cough that won't go away after several visits. I use fenugreek one teaspoonful every day to keep pre-diabetes under control. I get rid of pimples in one or two days using a black walnut extract. I get rid of flu or cold infections in one to two days with some antiviral herbal remedy. It used to take several weeks until I found this. You do need medical help when something cannot be cured without surgery but there are times you can save your life with self-cure if you know how to do it. I am not a doctor so I cannot advise anybody except my immediate family. If you ask a doctor about alternative medicine, there is very little chance they know anything about it and they generally have no interest. In the specific instances you cite, it's good to hear you've had specific successes with a homeopathic approach. Just keep in mind that correlation isn't causation. That is to say, taking something while sick, then getting better, could simply be that the specific condition ran it's course and wasn't necessarily ""cured"" by the home treatment. However, what's being discussed in this thread is specific to coronavirus. If modern medical science develops a cure for this particular virus and it's based on walnut extract, that would be a massive win for the world. The impact this illness is having on the world in economic terms, as well as in the cost of human life, is much higher than any potential profits made by pharmaceutical companies. Folks are free to take whatever steps they are comfortable with to handle their own medical issues, but we just don't allow them to post anything as a cure for coronavirus without it being supported by verifiable, reproducible clinical studies. I am not posting any cure for coronavirus because I have not contracted it. If I do later, I have some ideas in mind which I think might work only if used soon after the infection. The experiences I stated had repeated success. The cures given to me by the medical profession had repeated failures.  For many years I turned a blind eye to alternative medicines and I admit many alternative medicines do not work. It takes some experimentation and a lot of research (surveying others for their experiences) to find what works and what is hearsay. One thing I am sure of is I was not cured because the sickness ran its course because with me it never runs its course without intervention. I would like to comment on, and clarify where apolactoferrin and zinc comes from.  The apolactoferrin is derived from milk whey.  The more concise  way would be to call it bovine apolactoferrin, (blf).  Are body produces its own lactoferrin, which has differences from blf.  They two lactoferrins do share a large commonality. If your going to put some compound is your system, using one that is related to a natural compound and has a GRAS certification seems less likely to cause problems.  Research papers on lactoferrin is rich in history and wide spread.  The various investigations of lacteferrins have covered, antibactrial, antivirus, cancer treatment amoung others.  Commercial applications noted are for meat treatment, acne treatment and others I have not looked into. Comparing current compounds,  Hydroxychloroquine has a molecular weight of 335 versus aproximate molecular weight of 76,000 to 78,000 for blf.  What I see is a gecko versus Godzilla.  Not that Godzilla is stronger than a gecko just finer targeting.  Godzilla has parts and functions that may do the same thing in narrow cases, but Godzilla can do more things with the functional parts than a gecko.  Working in tune with the immune system  is a lactoferrin bonus.  A human mothers colostrum has a level of 5 to 7 gm/l level of lactoferrin, which had to make on wonder why such elevated levels, ""protection"". I'm not going to comment on Zinc at this time.  I am very leary of homeopathic, and naturopathic remedies, I'm just looking for research into my walnut extract, (that is a joke for the overly serious).  I'm am retired and tired of the way a very small microbe effects me and the rest of the world. PAULA  ECATERINA  FLORIAN1,*,  MIHAELA  TRIF1,  ROBERT W.

In #5 reference in the discussion they refer to zinc saturated bovine apolacotferrin as a possible treatment. I find it disappointing that nobody will allow talk of treatment, to talk about the science behind the treatment they are asking about. I left a cancer support group which absurdly restricted us from talking to each other about treatment, so it was a pointless group with no real support. To me you should actively support that discussion with real science. I mean, if the Absurdity in our nation's capital can say deadly and silly treatments in public, we should be able to talk about this. There's little reason to discuss science here if we aren't going to discuss the most relevant and interesting aspects of the science. Cause and correlation is left out in this entire episode of Covid-19.  There is very little, if any, quantitative causation or correlation of mitigating Covid-19 via face mask or social distancing. I am using social distancing as in the new definition of 6 feet; we use to social distance on our own quite effectively by understanding when someone is sick... stay away from them. Fauci lied to the public about face mask early on... he later explained that he lied because he did not want the face masks to be used by the public at the expense of Health Care Workers.  That sounds Noble but the Health Care System does not get their face mask from Home Depot, Walgreens, CVS, et al.  Hospitals actually have a Supply Chain which is separate from the general public and in no way does Home Depot interfere with medical distribution whatsoever. Now that Fauci is on record with his lying... why would we believe him going forward? This treatment is not homeopathic.  The amount of research done is vast and world wide.  A lot of research in Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, US, Spain, Italy, and many others including the Mid East. Different groups of researchers have suggested Lactoferrin for Covid-19 treatment.  There is not big money to be made with a purified milk protein and Zinc compared to drugs like Remdesivir.  The supply of bovine apo lacteferrin could also be an issue.  Recombinant human lactoferrin would not be as effective as bovine lactoferrin. I don't put a gold standard with one person treated, I and others think that Lactoferrin could play a role in covid-19 treatment.  Of interest the Chinese recently purchased a large quantity of Lactoferrin from Australia.  Never know what could happen long term. Update: 8/3/2020 Three  Lactoferrin trials planned in Egypt."

I'm not a medical person, so certainly no one should try the idea, but it seems like it might work. I'm thinking that since they say a low viral load will not infect you, perhaps the immune system will build up a defense if exposure is provided on a gradual basis. Does anyone know if this has been considered? I dont think that they know the necessary viral dose for infection yet, so even a small dose could potentially trigger a serious infection and significant immune response in some or many people.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/did-i-get-the-pfizer-vaccine-or-the-placebo.3307/,Did I get the Pfizer vaccine or the placebo?,"So, I got my first injection in the Pfizer study yesterday. My only symptoms were my temperature going up from 97.1 to 97.7 degress and some arm soreness the next day.  Is there any way to hazard a WAG whether I got the placebo or the vaccine? The increase in temperature is not significant. That small change can occur throughout the day, vaccine, placebo, or nothing. The arm soreness the next day might indicate you got the vaccine. The placebo however likely contains everything except the active component, so getting a sore arm is no guarantee of a vaccine. You might run a search on ""vaccine adjuvants"",  and then try to figure out if it contains anything that could cause the arm pain. Right now it would seem there is no way to be sure one way or the other. Firstly, good on you for volunteering. I suppose you could read the report from the earlier stage trial they . From what i saw the Pfizer trial was well tolerated. A placebo must have nothing biologically active or it is not a placebo A placebo is everything but the active. It may contain a variety of substances, some of which can cause an adverse reaction. Many people who receive placebos, especially injections, can have adverse reactions to the carriers, even though it is a placebo. And a placebo has no vaccine ""ingredients"". Fake diseases do not kill hundreds of thousands of infected people. On rethinking this, the most likely people who can tell if they got the active vaccine are those who develop symptoms like fevers and chills. Not having these symptoms proves nothing, but if you do, then you most likely got the vaccine which results from  the immune responses that gives the chills and fever. These symptoms usually result from the antigenic determinants of the vaccine, and are NOT found in the placebo. Actually the third largest cause of death in the USA every year is Iatrogenic death or DOCTOR CAUSED DEATH.  Funny how no one mentions the ventilators anymore after they were proven to kill the infected Just to clarify the effects of a placebo vaccine, these almost certainly have ""adjuvants"" included to enchance delivery of the vaccine to the immune system. Such adjuvants can cause significant adverse reactions without an active component present. This quote is from an NIH article (see link below) regarding this very topic : ""Local adjuvant-associated side effects range from mild injection site pain, tenderness, redness, inflammation and swelling"". And again, this is without the vaccine component, and in Pfizer's case, an mRNA format. Placebo alone can cause adverse reactions. It is a known fact. Titled: Comparative Safety of Vaccine Adjuvants: A Summary of Current Evidence and Future Needs : * You have no idea what you are saying.  The placebo is not a vaccine and as such needs nothing to enhance or stabilize it. Quite the contrary.  My prior posting on the nature of adjuvants is absolute fact.

I just want to know if anyone has had the same question/experience and can may be direct me in the right path or point me to a source or share their opinion. After watching a few YouTube videos by channel “MedCram” and talking to couple of my friends in USA, I started to research more about NAC, Quercetin, and other supplements. Based on the YouTube video ( ), I have started taking the following every day: ·        NAC 600mg ·        Quercetin 100mg ·        Zinc 50mg ·        Vitamin C 250mg ·        Vitamin D 1000 IU (I am deficient in Vit D) ·        General everyday multi-vitamin Is it ok for someone who healthy to take these supplements as a precautionary measure? Will taking NAC while healthy help in any way to boost one’s immunity or help fight COVID if one gets infected in the future? Are there any side effects that I should be worried about? Any age group that should avoid these? Unfortunately, doctors (general physicians) in my country don’t seem to know much about NAC or Quercetin. After taking couple of consultations I realized that they do not know much beyond a “google search”. If I have to get advice from a doctor, what type of a specialist can answer these questions? While I figure this out, I wanted to post this question out there and gather some more information. Thank you for your time. So, I've found myself wondering the same thing. After doing some research, it seems like the most sensible conclusion is this: There is no evidence to suggest that supplements or certain foods/ diets will actually boost our immune systems to specifically protect us from COVID-19. On that front, it's hygiene and distancing protocol that matters most. Having said that, it certainly wouldn't hurt to combine the right supplements with whole foods, an active lifestyle, stress control, etc. to help keep ourselves healthy and protected from a bunch of other conditions/ maladies. I found this to be particularly helpful: I don't believe in any supplements. I have tried many and none except one seems to do anything well. I found one advertised on an airline magazine that claimed to boost the immune system against respiratory infections, colds, flu, sore thought. I suffer from these things so bad and frequently, I was desperate to try anything. When I got off the flight, I had a sore throat and was sneezing often, a sure sign of an impending virus bout. I managed to find these supplements in town and could not believe it got rid of the problem in 15 minutes and that was it.  Since that day, it has worked for at least half a dozen times. I always take it before a flight and I don't come down with an infection that I almost always got. It seems to prevent as well as cure viral infections.  Looking at the ingredients, it has ginger extract, turmeric extract, and pomegranate. They are sold as lozenges. I don't know why they do not advertise it as a cure. I guess it costs a few billion dollars to approve it as a cure and perhaps because the ingredients are natural herbs based. I read reviews on the internet validating my finding with the only negative comment was about the price in the USA is about $16 for 10 pack Other Lozenges are cheaper but only soothe the throat for a few moments. I don't know if it can cure coronavirus but I am keeping a few packs handy to try if it comes to that. I suspect it might help some if taken before or soon after infection but who knows. This supplement is called Phytorelief-CC and is advertised on Amazon and sometimes on eBay.  I got several packs when I visited India and they were a lot cheaper."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/vaccinations.2565/,Vaccinations,"Is there any data on children developing symptoms or remaining asymptomatic and which childhood vaccines they have or have not had? Let me start by saying I think vaccination is generally a good thing, that does not mean we should not look into how it is used and the potential risks. I was vaccinated a couple of years ago for yellow fever without the risks being explained to me. I did my own research and took the risk. I still wonder if that was a good decision. Moving on to answer your question its hard to find good info - I will discuss that more later. There are reports showing oral polio vaccine being the source of more outbreaks of polio than wild polio in 2019 ""there have been 117 cases of naturally occurring polio. And in a galling development, there have been an additional 216 cases of what is called “vaccine-derived polio”—an accidental byproduct of the eradication campaign, brought into being by the campaign’s own vaccines. In other words, there now exist more cases of polio paralysis caused by vaccines than there are cases caused by the original wild virus."" From what I understand  there were issues with changing the vaccine mix being used In April 2016, those in charge switched from using a three-strain vaccine to a two-strain one which led to infections. There are those who claim that other vaccines are also linked to outbreaks of the condition they are supposed to stop or side effects to taking the vaccine. Whooping cough in Australia was cited in some reports. An example of the side effects of vaccines A 2017 study funded by the Danish Govt and others concluded that the death rate among children vaccinated with DTP vaccine in Africa was up to 5 times higher than children not vaccinated. Other studies have come to similar conclusions ""DTP was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated. No prospective study has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP. "" ""It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials. All currently available evidence suggests that DTP vaccine may kill more children from other causes than it saves from diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis. Though a vaccine protects children against the target disease it may simultaneously increase susceptibility to unrelated infections."" The DTP vaccine was in the following thousands of reports of death and brain damage. For further info about the risks related to vaccines visit the site below linked to Robert F Kennedy Jr who comes comes under much attack from the main stream press and pharma. However its a good place to find an alternative view and what studies back that view. A leading cancer Dr died after a rare reaction to a yellow fever vaccination - the intial reporting was amended from / to ""Prof Martin Gore died “as a result of a yellow fever vaccination”, as an earlier version said. Gore died following a yellow fever vaccination, and the trust released a statement confirming his death."" Real Info There is some considerable lack of transparency on vaccines - pharma companies are exempt from paying compensation for damage from vaccines and governments in the west pick up the bill The compensation paid by government connected agencies to compensate victims of vaccination is an example  of lack of transparency. There is no particularly easy way to find and see what vaccines compensation payments relate to which vaccine - total numbers of cases per vaccine, total or individual payment amounts etc In the UK the government even says it keeps no records of which vaccines are linked to compensation payments - which is pretty strange as each case must file a claim about whats happened so the records must exist about which vaccine was used and the payments are confirmation of damage the  DWP said it did not have any information on which types of vaccination were involved in the compensation payments. It said no such records were kept. Vaccine damage payments are one-off payments to people who are able to prove that they were severely disabled as a result of a vaccination. Political Lobbying and Advertizing data Pharma spent $4.45 billion over the past 22 years, the and health products industry has far outpaced all other industries in lobbying spending researchers estimated that medical marketing reached $30 billion in 2016, up from $18 billion in 1997 Vaccines and medicines other info My current belief based on what I have read is that its best not to have any vaccines for multiple conditions ie MMR vaccine etc and to avoid those that contain ""preservatives"" the comments that the amounts involved are insignificant is up to you to decided I believe it is very hard to get objective info on vaccines and medicines generally and this is provably linked to the money spent by big pharma on lobbying and spending on advertizing. Media, researchers and Drs that write on or do research on medicines get pressure placed on them to come to certain conclusions or join pharma research programs. There are few entities that fund research with no expectation of some financial benefit in the end particularly in the private sector. There has been a long history of safety issues only coming out years later. It is unlikely that anything is different now. May 24, 2020:  Philippe Douste-Blazy, Cardiology MD, Former France Health Minister and 2017 candidate for Director at WHO, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, reveals that in a recent 2020 Chattam House closed door meeting, both the editors of the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine stated their concerns about the criminal pressures of BigPharma on their publications. Things are so bad that it is not science any longer. Some people disagree that drug trials are really effective or independent of the pharma drug cos funding them and that in most cases the human testing phase is short with examples of data being skewed or withheld. Contents of Vaccines I was looking at the Robert F Kennedy Jr web site on vaccine - there is a link to a study on asymptomatic transmission of whooping cough and vaccines which says ""In light of current evidence and our results, we cannot dismiss the potential far-reaching epidemiological consequences of asymptomatic transmission of B. pertussis and an ineffective B. pertussis vaccine."" Also a 9th July 2020 post sets out some info on the MMR vaccine studies and possible long term effects I believe overall the benefits of vaccines are very significant but that does not mean we need to accept that there are no risk or should not seek to improve the vaccines. The drugs companies seek to maximise profits using the existing vaccines and seem to have little or no interest in updating what they already sell. Here is a good video on vaccines by a phd who previously worked for the US CDC and at US military who has specialized in viruses and vaccines. Interesting comments on vaccines and how they interact with certain genes and also certain age groups and people. Interesting vaccine article One side effect that could occur upon exposure is known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE); this rare phenomenon paradoxically leaves the body more vulnerable to severe infection after vaccination, and was previously observed in animal studies of vaccines for coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, Live Science previously reported. ""One of the things you have to be careful of when you're dealing with a coronavirus is the possibility of enhancement,"" Fauci said in an interview with the journal JAMA on April 8. Some vaccines cause a dangerous phenomenon known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which paradoxically leaves the body more vulnerable to severe illness after inoculation. I read in an article published a while ago that there is some doubt over whether ADE will be a significant consideration with the sars-cov-2 vaccines because the phenomenon is mostly seen when the virus attacks the macrophages such as in Dengue fever and this doesnt seem to be the case with sc2. There seems to be some conflicting info  about ADE and covid-19 - the risks are not known particularly from infection by a new strain of covid-19 after vaccination against an earlier strain The first article indicats why ADE maybe a risk and was seen in earlier MERS animal studies. The second older link says ADE was not seen in limited covid-19 animal trials from April 2020 Dengue Fever, COVID ‐19 (SARS‐CoV ‐2), and Antibody‐Dependent Enhancement (ADE ): A Perspective: 07 June 2020 The link below works In summary, in both SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV infected anti‐spike S‐protein NAbs are present. They can induce experimentally in vitro and in vivo ADE mediated by FcγRII receptor virus entry. Previous immunization by vaccination or infection might aggravate symptoms of a follow‐up infection as described above for dengue fever, such complications were also observed for common influence and other viral infections (24). Are there indications that ADE might be relevant in the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic? By nature, at this time point, trustworthy proofs for ADE playing clinically a role are not available and might be expected earliest in fall of 2020. Even so, the potential threat of ADE has to be investigated more closely, particularly in view of the vast number of recovered individuals who have already developed immunity. Thus, ADE is of relevance for the strategies for vaccine development and therapeutic agents. For example, ADE can play a role in individuals with immunity and NAbs against strain A if the next infection is by RBD mutated strain B. Antistrain A NAbs may not neutralize strain B, or antibody titers are too low for sufficient neutralization, or NAbs have efficient neutralizing capabilities, but cell entry occurs via FcγRII into APCs or B cells (43) (see Fig. 1). This article mentions ADE has so far not been seen in animal testing Thanks for the above links, they were very helpful in giving me a better understanding and appreciation of the phenomenon of ADE, and how this might relate to the Sars-cov-2 vaccine efforts. Subsequent to the publication of the article that I initially linked to, a study was released ( ) that demonstrated sars-cov-2 infection of macrophages in vitro. As with Sars-cov, the infection was observed to be abortive, in that the virus did not successfully replicate upon infection. However, upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemicals was noted from the infected macrophages which suggests one possible mechanism for increased disease severity through ADE after vaccination. The issue of immune enhancement seems to have been an obstacle to the development of a vaccine for Sars-cov, and both animal testing and in vitro experiments have suggested more severe disease when the infection was introduced in the presence of prior immunity, particularly neutralising antibodies to the spike protein. Given much of the Sars-cov-2 vaccine effort will expect to induce robust neutralising antibody response, this may be a cause for concern. On the other hand, it is noted that in vitro experiments do not necessarily provide proof of ADE in vivo, and that certain ADE observations may be both virus and/or species-specific ( ). Further, challenge to sars-cov-2 vaccinated rhesus monkeys did not show signs of ADE. ADE can also be avoided through vaccine design, and various methods are described, including T cell vaccine ( ) It is difficult to reach a firm conclusion on the matter, given the lack observable instance of ADE in sars-cov-2, but I find previous research hard to ignore and the absence of a sars-cov vaccine, whilst perhaps explained by substantially reduced need and funding, is telling. I think this is a critically important issue given how widespread vaccination is expected to be administered, and perhaps deserves more awareness. You might want to look into the work Prof Petrovsky from Australia did on a human SARS vaccine. Funding got pulled for the human trials and the focus switched to Ebola. Prof Petrovsky developed vaccines for Ebola, MERS and an animal SARs vaccine. The comments that SARs and Covid-19 are similar and a human SARs vaccine could have saved time with a covid-19 vaccine seem significant Professor Petrovsky, who has received about $30 million from the NIH for a range of projects, said he received a commitment from the agency to fund his SARS vaccine all the way through to human trials if it were successful at each stage of testing. His vaccine proved successful in animals and he needed just $US1.5 million to finish the project. But in 2010 the NIH backflipped and told researchers it would not fund any further SARS vaccine research, with the focus to switch to Ebola and Influenza. “It was brutal. It wasn’t just ‘cut SARS funding’, it was ‘stop funding today’,” he said. “They’d already invested a billion dollars – and what was crazy was not closing that last unanswered gap.” The NIH did not respond to requests for comment. Not finishing the SARs vaccine project calls into question the NIH leadership The time frame for development was 2004 to 2010 to get to human trials makes me wonder about whats being done now to get a covid-19 vaccine. Also given the leadership at the NIH appeared to make a really stupid strategic decision on the SARs vaccine and that vaccine makers are not legally liable if it goes wrong also makes me wonder even more about those who are being relied on to provide health leadership at the NIH. It does seem that both the WHO and the NIH make many decisions for political and not health reasons. Given everything I am concerned about the ADE issues versus the political pressure for a vaccine There are a couple of interesting videos on vaccines the first is from CSPAN and the floor of Congress The Congressman states he wanted the Congressional record to show what info he had and he requested a Congressional investigation The statement in Congress is about a whistleblower from the CDC who provided 1000s of pages of information to a Congressman about his colleagues withholding and destroying data showing severely adverse results in CDC clinical trials on MMR vaccines linking it to autism The whistleblower information is about CDC vaccine studies later published in peer reviewed medical journals with data withheld A news report on this is below Dr. William Thompson, lead scientist at the CDC, admits that the CDC manipulated and omitted data that clearly showed a causal link between the MMR vaccine and this could be as high as a 300% increase in autism in male African American children. Robert de Niro also has concerns about the MMR vaccine and autism which he mentions in a press interview. He calls for an open investigation into the subject of vaccines, the interview centers around a documentary on vaccination being withdrawn from a film festival following pressure against the film being shown The whole subject of vaccination seems very problematic Below is a link to pro vaccine comments on a later study. One of the comments made in the link is ""Among kids with an affected sibling, those who'd received one MMR dose by age 2 were actually one-quarter less likely to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, the study found. The odds were even lower among those who'd received two doses by age 5. So is the MMR actually ""protective"" against autism? Probably not, King said ."" However a later Danish study finding positively for the MMR vaccine shows no postive MMR and autism sibling relationship benefit infact shows a negative and adverse relationship but does not address this  (see point 7 below for full comment). the “survival curve” shows that more boys vaccinated with MMR (with autistic siblings) are diagnosed with autism than unvaccinated boys. Further critics point out important flaws in the recent favorable study from Denmark on the MMR vaccine by Hviid et al. (2019, Annals of Internal Medicine) entitled, “Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccination and Autism: A Nationwide Cohort Study” The authors claim that their work, “strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination.” However a number of key points are made by Dr Hooker who was involved in the disclosure of the data in the CDC study linking MMR and autism The points are as follows 1. Children were notably missing from the study sample: First and foremost is the underascertainment of autism cases within their data sample.  The study authors used Denmark population registries of children born in Denmark of Danish-born mothers which should reflect the current reported autism incidence in Denmark at 1.65% (Schendel et al. 2018, JAMA).  However, the autism incidence within the sample of the Hviid et al. paper is 0.98%, meaning that approximately 4,400 autistic children are missing from this study.  The authors do not discuss the discrepancy in the number of cases. 2. Many of the children in the sample were too young for an autism diagnosis: The most probable reason for the discrepancy in cases is that the sample in the Hviid et al. paper is too young to completely ascertain autism diagnoses.  The average age of sample is 8.64 years with a standard deviation of 3.48 years.  Age of autism diagnosis on average is reported as 7.22 years with a standard deviation of 2.86 years.  Assuming that the age of diagnosis follows a standard bell curve, this would mean that 31.5% of the sample was too young to get an autism diagnosis.  This could account for as many as 3,400 additional cases not included in the analysis, which would bias the outcomes to favor not finding a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. 3. Failure to eliminate those with autism related to genetic conditions from the sample: In addition, individuals who were diagnosed with genetic comorbidities (known to lead to autism) after age 1 were “censored,” meaning that they were followed until the time of diagnosis, but not removed from the study.  Thus, they were counted among the sample with many of them most likely autistic due to a genetic condition.  These should have appropriately been eliminated from the sample. 4. Use of two (2) different MMR vaccines: Also, two different MMR vaccines were used in this study.  The GlaxoSmithKline Prolix® formulation was used from 2000 to 2007 and Merck’s MMR®II formulation was used from 2008 to 2013.  Prolix® contains the Schwarz measles strain and MMR®II contains the Ender’s Edmonston measles strain.  Thus, children using the Merck formulation were much too young to receive an autism diagnosis as the oldest they would be at the time of study is 6 years of age or younger.  This is important for comparison to the experience in other countries, especially the U.S. where the Merck formulation was used exclusively for the entire study period. 5. Failure to control for the “dosage effect”: In addition, the age at which Danish children in the sample received their second dose of MMR vaccine was dropped from 12 years to 4 years in 2008.  This means that children born after 2004 would get two MMR vaccines prior to the average age of an autism diagnosis, whereas children born prior to 2004 would have received only one MMR vaccine.  If indeed there is a “dosage effect” of the MMR (i.e., where both doses were causally related to autism), this could not be elucidated in the sample and again, this would bias the results erroneously to not find a relationship. 6. Statistical method failed to capture those children with a delayed diagnosis of autism: The authors also used a non-transparent statistical method where “person-years” were considered following the MMR vaccine to an autism diagnosis where children who received a diagnosis soon after receiving their first MMR vaccine would be weighted more heavily than children with a delay in diagnosis. This makes no sense given that the age of autism diagnoses varies widely among populations based on access to services and severity of the autism case, among other factors.  This type of method is “borrowed” from infectious disease epidemiology where an exposure directly leads to a disease state rather quickly, for example, chicken pox.  However, the method has no place in evaluating chronic sequelae to vaccination which may take a period of years to receive an accurate diagnosis. 7. Vaccinated male siblings of children with autism show more autism diagnoses: It is interesting to note the increased incidence of autism in boys with autistic siblings in the vaccinated group shown in Figure 2 of the article’s supplement. The increase towards the end of the “survival curve” shows that more boys vaccinated with MMR (with autistic siblings) are diagnosed with autism than unvaccinated boys. The difference is not statistically significant but this may be an artifact of the very small subset of boys considered in this analysis. The study authors also cite the CDC’s Destefano et al. 2004 study which actually shows a statistically significant relationship between MMR timing and autism incidence. This is discussed further in a reanalysis of CDC’s data in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons (Hooker, 2018). 8. Conflict of interest of the study authors It should be noted that three of the study authors are currently employed at the Statens Serum Institut which is a for-profit vaccine manufacturer in Denmark.  In addition, this work was funded by a grant from the Novo Nordisk foundation. Novo Nordisk is a Danish multinational pharmaceutical manufacturer. These are two serious conflicts of interest. The lead author, Anders Hviid was the second author on the New England Journal of Medicine MMR autism paper from 2002 (Madsen et al. 2002). This research was completed despite the fact that the study authors had never received proper ethics approval to complete the study.  A detailed analysis of this is featured by Children’s Health Defense. (Those involved with providing data and evidence to the CDC and receiving CDC grants have been charged in the  USA with fraud etc and are currently fugatives) With these issues, this paper cannot be relied upon as evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. There are certainly a lot of unanswered questions. Some Drs have suggested vaccines should be given in single doses, to older children and well spaced out as an alternative but these suggestions never seem to get addressed from a medical point of view. Also any concerns expressed about compounds used in vaccines get labelled as anti vax, rather than as seeking a better understanding of what is going on despite some serious research indicating that injecting these compounds may result in these not being expelled from the human body (unlike consuming them orally) Some open debate and research would be helpful, rather than the current format of seemingly labelling all questions as being just anti vaxers causing trouble All medicine moves forward with technology and understanding so hopefully vaccines can as well."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/the-hitchhickers-guide-to-immunity.2783/,The Hitchhicker's Guide to Immunity,"Just for the record this has nothing to do with hitchhiking but I thought it would get your attention. In discussing COVID-19 exposure, treatments and vaccines, people refer to establishing immunity against SARS-CoV-2, without clarifying how they are using the term immunity. What this virus does to the body with various symptoms and how patients are treated and recover eventually leads to some type of immunity. Immunity may be temporary and last for days, weeks, months or years such as the flu. Or immunity may last a lifetime such as with measles. As an aside, measles has the ability to wipe away 20-50% immunity to previous diseases leaving a person vulnerable to previous diseases for which they once had immunity. When someone has immunity to COVID-19 this means different things to different people. When the WHO said having COVID-19 doesn’t mean you could never get it again the press jumped on that. What people hear, what they read, who they talk to and what research is being pushed through the media have been influencing people’s perception of immunity. There are degrees of immunity. If you get infected with the same virus again it could be just as bad as the first time, you could get infected but have a milder case, it could be so mild you don’t even know you have it but you are still contagious and are spreading it to others, or you may never get infected again. There are no guarantees as everyone’s body reacts differently and this virus attacks differently. Many people believe if they get infected again it won’t be too bad because our bodies would be able to fight it before it gets out of hand.  Do you think if you have immunity you are safe to be around vulnerable people because you can’t infect them? What degree of immunity would allow you to feel safe around others? There is no guarantee you would not shed virus and be contagious again, and whether this is related to the degree of immunity you have. Natural Active Immunity occurs when we are exposed to a pathogen, develop a disease and then develop immunity against it such as measles, mumps, or influenza. This is also known as Adaptive Immunity and is unique to vertebrates. Natural Passive Immunity occurs during pregnancy when antibodies are passed from mother to fetus through the placenta or through breast milk to an infant. This is temporary and helps infants fight infections for the first few weeks or months of life until its own immune system is fully developed. Breast feeding, when possible, is really important to the health of an infant. Natural Passive Immunity is also used when someone receives medical injections of gamma globulins. Artificial Immunity occurs when the body is given immunity by providing intentional exposure to a disease with small quantities or parts of the pathogen, such as with a live vaccine or a killed vaccine. This occurs with diseases such as measles and the flu. You can develop immunity against the measles or influenza by receiving the vaccines or by being exposed to the diseases. We know immunity to measles is for a lifetime, whether you are exposed to the pathogen and develop the disease or you receive a vaccination, whereas immunity to the flu lasts for about a year whether you get the flu vaccine or get the flu. In either case of the flu you are open to getting it again the following year. We are born with innate immunity, a non-specific combination of physical, chemical, and cellular defenses to prevent pathogens from entering our body. Think of tears when you get something in your eye, sneezing or coughing when you get something in your nose or lungs, and fevers. Other organisms in nature also have innate immunity, think of plants that are poisonous to eat or the tentacles of a jellyfish. Our white blood cells, known as leukocytes, are either phagocytes that surround and absorb pathogens and effectively eat them or they are lymphocytes known as B and T cells. The adaptive immune system involves the production of B and T cells. These cells are both made in the bone marrow but must mature to become activated. The letters represent where in the body these cells mature, B cells mature in the bone marrow while T cells are transported and mature in the thymus gland. As B cells or T cells are produced, they are cloned to specifically target the pathogen they have detected. Once matured they live longer in our bodies providing that long-term immunity we all hope for, so we don’t get infected with the same disease twice. As B cells produce antibodies, these remain in our blood and provide protection from future infections. B cells fight bacteria and viruses by making antibodies which lock onto their target and hang on until other immune cells can destroy the invader. There are two types of T cells, Helper T cells and Killer T cells. Just as the names imply, Helper T cells communicate with other cells particularly triggering the B cells to produce antibodies and alerting other leukocytes, while Killer T cells destroy cells that have already been infected. Yes, they kill our own cells to get rid of invaders and work particularly well fighting viruses. If you have a similar disease to let’s say COVID-19 and get cross immunity from a different pathogen is that natural or is that artificial? Does it matter? How long immunity lasts and the degree to which it protects you does matter. Understanding the type of immunity and what triggers each is critical to understanding why an alternative to vaccination with a competitive disease could be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

The distinctions you make between the different types of immunity is really useful to remember."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/vaccine-from-live-virus.2638/,Vaccine from live virus,"If it really takes about 1000 covid-19 particles to start an infection, why not give healthy people a very small dose, say 50 or 100 particles initially, so the B-cells start learning to recognize it?  These people would have to quarantine to avoid larger exposures or infecting others.   Maybe they would need more and larger doses to build up enough memory B-cells to ward off a large infection later. Could this approach be practical in a very short time from now?   Shorter than current vaccine efforts because we already have the virus to treat with? I realize this is probably a very naive question and the answer will be, yeah, that’s already how it works, and it just takes time to develop dose(s) and schedule.   Also we’d need to somehow make sure people stay quarantined, even if they feel ok after a few days.  I suppose quarantine could be enforced, but that’s pretty creepy and would get a lot of backlash.   Multiply the lockdown protestors by 1000. Hard to imagine any politician sticking his/her neck out to support that. Advantages with this approach: 1.    immunity is developed without getting sick. 2.   the population could be immunized in a fashion, damping infection spikes. This would ease the burden on health care. Companies and big organizations (the military for instance) could rotate staff through this treatment. That predictability would help them effectively plan operations, finances, purchasing, production, major projects, etc. That would help them survive and thereby reduce unemployment and help the economy. I could be wrong on this, but that 1000 particles could just be the amount known to spread via a sneeze, as noted in . I think the issue would be that the immune responses to any exposure at all to COVID-19 particles is wildly unpredictable. With so much variability in immune responses, my worry with this would be that it's incredibly difficult to expose people to the COVID-19 particles in a controlled way. The closest equivalent would be outright infecting them a la herd immunity, ."

How could those with the most likely damaged respiratory tracts and lungs escape the ravages of the coronavirus.  Even now Researchers are studying the possible effects of nicotine on the coronavirus and ultimately missing the obvious.  As per my previous Post of “The Only Weapon We Have Against COVID-19 Is Heat” the answer is quite clear, every time a smoker inhales, they are unwittingly giving their lungs a Hyperthermic Treatment of hot smoke and heating up their lungs enough to prevent the coronavirus from replicating.  The overwhelming evidence in my post of “People Are Dying Of COVID PNEUMONIA Because of Lung Temperature” with hypothermic sedentary seniors and people who live, work and commute in cold outdoor AND refrigerated environments, All experiencing cold lungs and being the hardest hit with COVID PNEUMONIA.  The evidence keeps getting stronger and stronger, the Key to COVID-19 is Temperature and Heat. Is there a source for this research showing a lack of smokers in Wuhan's infected population? I mean, this could just be regional thing, whereby perhaps there isn't a huge population of smokers. In any case, smoking seems to intensify how much your lungs suffer from coronavirus. Here's a good review: Here is the link that references the research into the study of why active smokers are disproportionately not affected by COVID-19 with the suggestion that it could be the nicotine that is responsible for the immunity. Personally I believe that any type of Hyperthermic Treatment to the lungs (which smoking definitely is) is effective in reducing the ability of the virus to replicate in the lungs.  This continued recommendation by the WHO to take fever reducing drugs for comfort for those that are fighting the virus goes against everything I have read about fever triggering our immune systems to fight infections.  It seems to work for every other mammal on earth, why are they ignoring it for humans and even shutting it down with drugs.  In fact, fever has never even been suggested as a possible treatment for COVID-19, WHY IS THAT?  They keep touting that there is virtually NO treatment approved for treating the disease and yet they ignore and destroy the one thing that 100 million years of evolution gave us for free.  WHY IS THAT? Cigarette smoke but not nicotine activates Nrf2 gene transcription factor that is generally regarded as a master regulator of inflammation, anti-oxidants and immune regulation. It is included in the Covid 19 Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency post I added to this forum in the last couple of days but right towards the end of my video presentation. Basically, the excess of Angiotensin II because of disrupted ACE2 enzyme switches off Nrf2. Because cigarette smoke is harmful, it is able to bypass the blockage to switch on the gene to counter-regulate inflammation and other adverse effects which are actually beneficial in this instance however unlikely it may seem. The other possibility is that smokers are accustomed to respiratory difficulties and cold so are less likely to attend hospital and also much less likely to be put on a ventilator which may even reduce chances of survival. They also are more likely to have increased mucous which can engulf viruses and reduces their ability to infect, perhaps it is a combination of all three. It may interest you to note that the UK 'BAME' population smoke 1/2 as much as the white and mixed group yet are 3x more likely to be admitted to hospital with similarly bad prognosis.  The other factor I have in my sights for that is the prevalence in that group of G6PD deficiency - it is an enzyme that is only two steps away from Adenosine Deaminase which is well known to lead to Severe Combined Immune Deficiency and is implicated in Kawasaki Disease now being observed in children positive for SARS CoV2."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/coronavirus-toilet-flushing-open-windows-question.2515/,"coronavirus, toilet flushing, open windows question","Hi everyone I would love your scientific viewpoints on this. I'm trying to work out the level of risk of catching coronavirus in my apartment block.  The actual apartments are sealed off from one another (apparently) though I always know when my neighbour downstairs has made toast!  But I'm not worried about that, she's 85 and staying home for the whole of this crisis. What I'm wondering about, is there's a window I long to open, especially now as it's getting hot, but to the left and right of it, about 3 - 4 metres away, are the bathroom windows of my neighbours.  Not something that's ever bothered me before, but I know that when people flush toilets, any germs are aerosilised, so would fly out of their open sky light windows and maybe travel through my window.  Maybe not a problem if I was nowhere near the window, but I'm a metre from it sat at a desk. Of course all this is assuming a neighbour has the infection, but just wondering, would you have it open at a time like this?  I have other windows but they don't seem to bring in the breeze as much as this one. Also would you use a portable air conditioner during this pandemic.  I imagine the concern there is for others rather than for myself as the air con extracts hot air into the street below.  There are people walking by about  2 - 3 metres down.  You cannot feel the hot air from the street at all, it disperses before then, but I'm thinking of viral particles (that's assuming there's infection in my home, I'm not ill but I don't want to add to this pandemic by pumping virus out of my windows, so just looking for considered scientific answers).  Also wondering if the way air con operates it is swirling air around my apartment and therefore it may move germs about for me inside.  I don't think my apartment is particularly well sealed off from my immediate neighbour.  When he goes in and out of his front door he is literally standing in front of mine with only about a foot from him and the door.  So I have assumed that my front door is a riskier area and I don't stand near it, etc, only go there if I'm going out or coming in.  So I don't really want swirling air around my apartment if the risk is considered to be high right now. If it's felt that either of these things carry significant risk then it's simple, I won't do them.   I'll put up with it for as long as necessary, but I'm just wondering if I'm being a little bit ocd as other people don't seem to worry so much and they all have their windows open. Thanks anyone?  even if you don't know, opinions are welcome... I am very much like you! Some might call us crazy, but I like to think of us as prepared! I doubt that enough germs would survive from flushing a toilet and make it from their bathroom to yours. Your door, however, is a hot spot, in my opinion. I would avoid that door whenever you can. At my house, we have a ""germ door"" which we only use when we have to go out (once a month for groceries) and then we avoid it for 5 days, assuming that it's contaminated. Our back door is the one we use when we just want to go outside to let the dog out or to be in the backyard and get some sunlight! Of course, at my house, we go even further than most. Even before COVID-19, we have always been very ""germ-conscious"". My fiance says he's not germaphobic, but germ-conscious. So, we have always come straight in, set our phones and keys down, and quarantined them for 48 hours (just for colds and flus!). Then we wash our hands (now the faucet handle is germy, perpetually), and we head straight to the shower. You have to turn the water on, then undress, and wash your hands. Clothes go straight in the hamper, etc. Anything we bring in the house has to quarantine for 2 days (5 with coronavirus around)... So, we take it extremely far. We don't eat out or touch our face in public. It may sound absurd, but we haven't had a cold or flu in 5 years. (Which can't be good for our immune systems... but he has to do it for his sanity. So I do, too). All that being said, I would definitely be okay with opening the window and so would he. The door, though, I'd avoid! But it really is your decision because if you don't feel comfortable, then what's the point? Thanks MMKV I'm interested that your partner would be ok re the window open considering how careful he is.  So is the thinking that anything that aerosilises will fall to the ground before it travels 2 metres?  Here in the UK they tell us to stand 2 metres apart for that reason but I wondered with the force of the flush. But then I suppose most particles would hit the walls and window before exiting, then they have at least 2 metres to fall, more likely it's 3.5.  (I keep looking out of the window to try and work out the distance in the air, lol). If we just had a flu pandemic, I'd have the window open without a second thought as I would imagine it's unlikely flu virus could travel that far and if it did, low probability that I would actually pick enough up on my hands via the desk as I wash them regularly anyway, and clean the desk regularly.   Also I would think the fresh air would make my lungs healthier. I love that you guys take all those measures just for colds and flu.   At least you are not infecting others if you're that careful.  I had a bad flu in January (still wondering if it was Covid as I knew it was a 'bad flu' and wondered at the time if I'd got H1N1 or something).  I believe I caught it off my neighbour when we were talking in the communal garden (only a foot apart), he'd been ill for 2 weeks by then so of course I thought he just had a residual cough.  It could have been covid.  He saw me the other day in the street and said he's being careful but thinks that virus we had in Jan was Covid. It might be worth mentioning to your partner that apart from the above, I hadn't had colds or flu for around 8 years.  I didn't take any special measures although I am a hand washer when I get home, shoes off by the front door (not worn in the house) and I'm very conscious about not putting my fingers in my eyes, nose or mouth, but that's it.  Mobile phone would get cleaned occasionally, but I must admit, if there was a nasty flu going around I would use an alcohol wipe on the phone. Thanks for your thoughts and I welcome any further about the window, lol.  I should say, my neighbour has to walk past that window as he goes downstairs, but I'm not worried there as I'd only want it open on my work from home days, so he would be out at work then anyway. In the US, it‘s 6 feet. I’m not sure the conversion, but it is probably close to 2 meters. His thinking is that the chances of the particles making their way from your neighbor‘s toilet out his window and into yours are too slim to be concerned. (I just asked him to be sure!) But again, he’s definitely not a scientist. All of his ways are based on his own research and logic. It’s kind of like what you were saying about if it were the flu... and how the probability would be low. MMKV, thanks.  You can tell him I've got the window open, it's night time now and there is lovely cool air coming in The scientific answer to this kind of question is not likely to come by.  Who would want to play with the virus? The answer has to be based on logic and imagination. I would think that some viruses would come through your window from the neighbor's toilet if he is infected. This would depend on which way the wind blows. If there is no wind you probably will get some virus. If you ever smelled any toilet odor coming in, it would be a sure sign. If you have a co-operative neighbor you can give him some incense sticks to burn or some aromatic substance like peppermint oil to put in his toilet and see if you can smell any of these. If you smell it, it is a sure thing. If you don't smell it is uncertain because of the wind issue. From study of worldwide infection reports and some scientific papers and virus histories, I am certain that coronavirus spreads by air. The 6 feet distance and handwashing will not stop the virus. Thanks harpat949 I have wondered about this.   The 'safer' window overlooks the street and anyone walking by would be 3 metres down and I think the probability of them having coronavirus, then coughing, the droplets going against gravity, then navigating into my window, then crossing over the room to the other side where I sit, is probably low  :-D I have put up another post.  Its about using air con.  The thing is it's now too hot NOT to have windows open, and even with them my apartment is really unbearable to be in to work.  And I work here a few days a week. Also having all the windows open seems to be bringing in loads of noise.  But I've had labyrinthitis in the last week so it might be that. If I have air con on it will vent out of the front window, with the street below.  People are 3 metres down, not many walk along there.  You cannot feel or hear the vent from the street which I think must be a good thing.  But I'm not sure if viral particles would safely disperse in that situation, coming out of the vent.  I don't have symptoms.   So I don't think I'd be 'venting' stuff out of my window, but I don't feel I can use it until I know for sure.  Especially as it may also impact me, I don't know.  It does tend to trigger a little bit of asthma the first time I put it on in summer but then my lungs adjust, so clearly it affects the lungs and I don't want to affect them too much at a time like this (even though normally it's not a problem and I wouldn't even think about it if it wasn't for the pandemic). Thanks for your reply I suggest you try the perfume/incense method to see if the air is going from the street level into your window.  The smoke from the incense stick will follow the air currents and give you a visual indication of what is happening.  The perfume method would likely be more accurate as there would be less gravity effect. If the wind conditions are constantly changing, you will have to try it many times."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/confusion-and-chaos-surround-coronavirus-testing-in-the-us.1264/,Confusion and chaos surround coronavirus testing in the US,"Mixed messaging from the government, media reports, social media and employers is causing frustration. Your article would help REDUCE the confusion and chaos, if you'd at least mention the fact that since a week ago (3/5), commercial labs are doing testing nationwide, with no limits announced. Patients must still have symptoms appropriate for the condition (as with ANY disease!) People should NOT go to social media for important & critical issues. You'll get more misinformation than truth. Looking at her signs, actually they don't really match COVID-19 symptoms. The confusion comes mostly from the ""official Government"" Daily News brief. Both the daily brief and the US CDC site are sending changing & conflicting info from day to day. On top of that many news media and even doctors often publish unsubstantiated ""facts"" which are either wrong or misleading or need ""detailed qualifications"". For examples, the face masks comments and guidelines are flying everywhere. It's often very misleading.  Why not taking off our prejudice & dark color glasses and look at the successful cases (in terms of flattening the curves effectively) from countries like South Korea and Singapore? Then you will not have any confusion. The Daily News brief is more like an election rally nowadays. Many statements are politics oriented or motivated hence creating false hope or misleading impression. When a Covid patient is hospitalized... what exactly does a hospital do?  I mean, if there is no cure why are we utilizing limited and costly hospital resources on something that is incurable?"
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/coronavirus-how-to-social-isolation-vs-quarantine.2240/,Coronavirus How To: Social Isolation vs Quarantine,"When a pandemic sweeps across the world, many people are stuck and don’t know what to do. A lot of terms get thrown around that are supposed to serve as a guide, but their meanings can be vague. To stop the spread of the virus, two ideas have been suggested and implemented: social isolation and quarantine. These both have their own meanings and purposes, so let’s look at which is appropriate for what situation. Social isolation is essentially what it sounds like. It means avoiding large crowds, having as little contact with others as possible, and generally keeping to yourself. This is a method to keep yourself safe from those who might be infected. This doesn’t mean you have to lock yourself in your house and tell everyone to stay away. But the less contact you have with others and the general public, the better. Quarantine is a more serious isolation method. Generally, those who are suspected to be ill are quarantined, meaning they’re kept away from the public so they don’t spread the virus if they do have it. People in quarantine aren’t showing symptoms, but that doesn’t mean they’re not contagious. A quarantine is generally ordered by the government, whereas social isolation is something you can choose to do. In order to stop a virus from spreading, both social isolation and quarantine are used in tandem. The less contact people have, the fewer chances the virus has to spread. During a pandemic, anything that can be done to slow the spread is important, so depending on your situation, consider what you can do to keep yourself, and others, safe. Acoording to WHO from their,Mar 29th update, there is no evidence of airborne transmission in over 75,000 COVID cases. Transmission is possible only within 1m (39 in) of people who cough or sneeze while infected or contact with contaminated surfaces. Australia, UK, European authorities enacted guidelines in accordance with the WHO report.  The CDC guidelines for social distancing and diverse ""face covering"" requirements through-out, in general, have zero evidentiary bases.  Any comments expressing various ""expert opinions"" without citing evidence, need to be removed, as they are spreading misinformation.  WHO cites three recent studies.  Remove the misinformation, in accordance with your guidelines, I else, require the journal evidence to support ""social distancing"". Thanks. If you test positive should you notify everyone you were in contact with?"

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/testing.1282/,Testing,"What does testing for and confirming COVID-19 do for the treatment plan? There is no cure. Unless you are in dire straits, you are sent home to self-quarantine. Testing does a ton to help governments, countries, cities, etc decide how to scale their efforts. Depending on the results, a city could be in the 'ok, we're alright but this might get bad so let's get going' or 'my goodness we've messed this up, we need to lock it all down ASAP.' I would love to agree with you but I take the exact opposite viewpoint.  Unless there is a standardized process with a fully compliant population you will never produce actionable data. People going in randomly (without strict guidelines) generates too many assumptions which dummy down conclusions. Already the misinformation, the politicizing of the virus, and the lack of transparency from the institutions has developed this into a problem.  Just look at the results we have so far... 1. Why would Laos rank 29 in fewest cases per M while Guiana is ranked 152?  Laos and Guiana are close in land size and you can fit the entire population of Guiana inside the city of Vientiane.  Laos does not have a better health care system than Guiana or least enough of an advantage to create such a disparity (Laos is #155, Guiana is#160 derived from WHO). 2. What good is there in testing?  They can't provide you with anything to help you; in fact, if you are sick it will increase your chance of spreading the disease. The age old rule of staying home if you are ill, actually works.  You already know you sick or you would not be tested. All the testing does is create animosity among various groups. Example: there is the possible ban on Americans traveling to the EU because the EU feels the USA does not have the Covid-19 under control due to an increase in reported cases.  You can't get more cases unless you test which may explain Laos' preferable ranking but it does not explain why Vientiane has 0 deaths and 9 cases while Asuncion, capital of Paraguay has 4 deaths and 93 cases. Both capitals have virtually identical population size of around 500K. 3. Testing just for the sake of testing.  This is not allowed unless you show symptoms. 4.  It has already been proven that collected information is not handled with care. There are too many conclusions being developed with partial information that is gathered under a non-standardized procedure.  Example:  When a new case is reported, was it from a recent case, was the person sick for 3 weeks prior to the announcement or was it two weeks? Did the person test positive but showed no signs of illness... and so on.  Then when this information is released there is insufficient background of the statistics to be cataloged into more detailed evaluation buckets. 5.  If reporting would actual report versus developing biased stories; there would be greater acceptance within the population. If this situation was not politicized and monetized, we could address this in a level headed manner.  Since we do not have standardization, since we do not have a professional News Reporting approach, and since we do not have transparency of statistics... it creates what we do have and that is a ball of confusion dominated by parochial interest bombarding the entire world with poorly researched stories and passing them off as ""fact"". 6.  Because of testing, there is an inflation of recorded deaths due to Covid-19.  Dr. Birx, of the Trump task force, stated plainly and unhesitatingly that if a person dies with Covid-19, the death is recorded as a Covid-19 death. There is no regard for preexisting conditions... the late great John Prine is a classic example. Bottom Line:  If you fell ill, stay home so others are not infected and then sign up for the Laotian Health Care System."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/why-are-children-missing-from-coronavirus-outbreak-cases.809/,Why are children 'missing' from coronavirus outbreak cases?,"UPDATE (4/24/20): There is new information available since the article below was published. Find a follow up . Adults, even healthy young adults, are felled by the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV much more readily than children. Here's why. Is it possible that the virus originated from mice? I remember in the 90s when I was 25 years old that doctors could not record my T3 and T4 because they had to inject my blood into a mouse to obtain an allergic reaction. They could never obtain the correct reaction from my blood because as an  adult I had some sort of mice immunity. The doctors said at the time, ""Only kids under 10 have this sort of immunity, that disappears later. You are a rare case."" So if most kids have this natural immunity to mice, can they have this natural immunity to Coronavirus, and if so, are they related immunity? Flu kills 630,000 per year. Yet who stops travelling when you hear of it? Did any stop travelling to the US last time it was killing so many? The cause of death is hypercytokinemia. Probably, the cytokine production in adult is much stronger than children. Children immune system is not fully developed and produce ""just nice"" level of inflammatory genes (cytokines). I'm wondering if photochemical oxydation of primary pollutants isn't messing around with the immune response increasing oxydative stress and causing the increased inflammation. Since children are, presumably, growing/regenerating cells at higher rate than adults, is it possible that the net of cells destroyed/compromised by the virus is lower in children and therefore results in less severe problems? I’m glad to see that I’m not the only one that has questioned that. lack of knowledge is lack of power! the RO rate of the flu meaning retransmission how many people each person with the flu will get sick is between 1.0 to 2.0 the RO of covid19 2.5  to 3.5 flu kills .05 percent of people who get it covid19 again between 2 to 3.5 percent of people who get it die while all the facts aren't known and some are debate able if covid19 spreads like the flu it will kill millions of people and it definitely seems to have the ability to spread alot better than the flu. and besides for the above the amount of severe hospitalization is 20 percent for covid19 for the flu out of 40 million American 200,000 hospitalization that's not 20 percebt while not everything coming out of chine can be trusted and the article may be true I personally have seen clips from inside Wuhan of lined up corpses of children did I use scientific method to verify the clips no but did they seem legit yes ..the data china is providing the USA isn't either legit 630,000 worldwide???? Could you cite your sources? At its peak, «2009 H1N1 Flu Pandemic – about 18,300 deaths in the United States and up to 203,000 deaths worldwide». We have to be careful of jumping to unwarranted conclusions. Two things to keep in mind. First is the nature of the reporting coming out of China. I seriously doubt we are getting the true story from China. Second is the population we see exposed to the coronavirus. Most of the travelers and tourist are adults. Children are being evacuated  from Wuhan, but no mention of the number. I suspect that number is low.  Or the 350 Americans evacuated from cruise ship in Japan. I think most of them were elderly with few if any children. Adults brought back to the United States are isolated and have little chance of spreading coronavirus to the general population which include children. I'm not so sure of the children's super immunity theory.  ""Since 2014, federal health officials have confirmed over 500 cases of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in the United States―a very rare but serious illness that can cause sudden polio-like symptoms such as weak muscles and paralysis. Most of these cases have been in children around 5 years old."" Or the illegal immigrate children getting sick in custody. Agree. I'm not sure why so many are questioning your numbers when it so easy to fact check. I seriously doubt we are getting the true story from China. However I can't find anything that says otherwise. Your source? ""Children are top of the totem pole here in China. "" I agree.  I would think that if children were dying at an alarming rate, that would be the last thing their government would want out.  I think children at risk would be the straw that broke the camel's back when it comes to people dissatisfaction with the government. What we are seeing here in the West are mainly adults, with the exception of an unknown number of children that were evacuated  from Wuhan. I was thinking more along the lines that children's lymphatic system is still capable of correctly functioning because it hasn't been intoxicated for decades by the polluted air that everyone is breathing. Just curious as to why they were testing your Thyroid levels in mice?? Was it experimental? Some reasons include: 1. The mortality rate of coronavirus so far is roughly 3-4 times higher than for the flu. 2. The flu typically kills people over the age of 65. If you are otherwise healthy and under 65, you are highly unlikely to die of the flu. But coronavirus is killing people in their 40’s and 50’s, and even younger. 3. There is no vaccination for coronavirus yet. You can be vaccinated for the flu and then be much safer if exposed while traveling. 4. Coronavirus has the potential to become a worldwide epidemic beyond anything we have experienced in our lifetimes. First, it could still mutate and become more deadly. And second, it has features that enable to spread easily, including that some people can have it without symptoms, so they don’t stay home and unwittingly affect others. So until we have a vaccination, authorizes are going to have to go to great lengths to try to contain it if we don’t want to risk massive loss of life. Ye strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.  This condemnation or woe was directed at the pharisees who were elderly, white men, religious leaders of that day.  In today's language, the gnat is the mosquito that causes the WNV.  So therefore little children are not involved. Yep, WHO - right there on their website for which you supplied the link - nfluenza may not always be thought of by most people as a serious illness – the symptoms of headaches, runny nose, cough and muscle pain can make people confuse it with a heavy cold. Yet seasonal influenza kills up to 650 000 people every year. Well we have quite a time dealing with influenza and is pretty managable, the influenza virus most likely will kill people with very low immunty  most of them very old people,but the coronavirus is new we still have a lot to learn from this virus,not having travel retstriction would help the virus spread more eaisly , and more people would die and the effects would be quite devestating for low income countries,considering that a high number of people do not have access to drinking water is easy to imagine what a coronvirus spread amongst those people would do. I personally think travel restriction helps by slowing down the rate of spread wich would give people more time to study the virus, and comeup with and effective treatment possibly a cure. Note that one of the 30 medications investigated by the Chinese for COVID-19 is an IL-6 inhibitor made by Roche subcutaneous monoclonal antibody. Do Children Cytokine Storm? Or are we just not watching our Children and COVID-19 efficacy closely? Okay, another theory where I'm sure I'll be hit with rotten tomatoes and others trying to kick me off boards.  WHAT IF something in newborn hematopoietic  stem cells could help produce a vaccine???  I KNOW they are saying children are affected but I'm not even convinced the few that supposedly have it, don't just have a common flu.  Something about babies and children plays a part. I think it's worth looking in to. Sadly it's like trying to shove the genie back into a bottle.  The enemy is loose and we have no idea where or how to find him.  Along with containment people need to NOT freak out but definitely have items at the ready at home in case things ramp up to  hysteria. If this gets twice as bad which it IS going to--be prepared to lock down at your home. It is a form of hypercytokinemia but not the classic ,1918 sort. The 1918 flu killed with hypercytokinemia, with rapid onset, haemoraging (when cytokines attack lung tissue)  but this 2019-nCoV seems to just fill lungs with gunk, slowly, often without the patient noticing till they can't breathe too well. Hypercytokinemia of that 1918 type killed those with the strongest immune reactions -- young soldiers. I think it may be because children have higher fevers than others. I explain the reasons for thinking so on this other thread on the same topic."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/an-alternative-to-vaccination-for-covid-19.2726/,An Alternative to Vaccination for COVID-19.,"Draft 2 June 2020, 2000 GMT This unfinished paper is to start a discussion on an alternative model for protecting humanity from COVID-19. By itself COVID-19 poses enormous moral and ethical challenges. The model presented in this paper poses its own additional moral and ethical challenges, some of which will be addressed herein. One of the most critical challenges of all is the time required until the World’s population is sufficiently protected from COVID-19. The time required impacts lives and suffering not only from the disease itself but also from the social and economic consequences of our current efforts to protect the World’s population. The economic consequences are not merely an abstract construct, but impact lives and suffering by the loss of the ability to meet basic human needs for food, shelter and education. Most COVID-19 research focuses on the production of antivirals and vaccinations. An alternative approach is to infect the population with a different disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, 229E, NL63, OC43 or HKU1. This could allow people to produce the helper T cells that would fight COVID-19, creating immunity on a faster timeline than vaccination production and distribution. The COVID-19 challenges far exceed the abilities of any one group or person. As a Systems Engineer, Computer Scientist and Applied Mathematician this is a request for collaboration from people and teams with the expertise and resources to address these unique challenges. Inoculating a sufficient portion of the World’s population with a vaccine to directly and indirectly, through herd immunity, protect humanity against COVID-19 is the gold standard but is not the only approach. One can imagine multiple ways to inoculate humanity for protection from COVID-19. Another approach would be to infect a sufficient portion of the World’s population with a minor disease that as a side effect provided some immunity to COVID-19. Vaccination with its individual delivery to each person provides greater control over the inoculation process and consequently lower risks. But this control comes at the cost of producing and distributing individual vaccines. Vaccination has at best a linear time, O( n ), production rate limitation to inoculate humanity. Infecting the World’s population with a disease gives up the individual control over the process with consequently higher risks. In exchange, it can at best achieve exponential spreading through the population and thus a Log time, O(Log( n )) complexity. At a high level Vaccination against COVID-19 consists of Discovering or developing a vaccine, Testing in animal models, Testing in humans, Clinical trials, Developing a production process, Constructing factories and supply chains to produce the vaccine, and Developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World’s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. At a high level Competitive Disease Propagation against COVID-19 consists of Discovering or developing a disease, Testing in animal models, Testing in humans, Clinical trials, Developing an infection process, and Developing world-wide education and infection networks to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World’s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. Comparing these two models shows many similar steps, with the similar steps taking comparable amounts of time. The key differences are that the Vaccination Model requires Constructing factories and supply chains, and Developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems, while the Competitive Disease Propagation Model requires Developing world-wide education and infection networks. These key differences affect how the two models scale to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World’s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. For the Vaccination model, the complexity of producing inoculations scales linearly, O( n ), for the number of inoculations required. The complexity of the transportation and distribution system is O(nLog( n )) or higher. For the Competitive Disease Propagation model, the complexity is O(Log( n )) for the number of inoculations required. To put numbers to this, conservatively assume that 6 Billion people or 75% of the World’s nearly 8 Billion population, need inoculations for adequate protection. A total combined global factory production capacity of 1 Million doses per day requires 6000 days or nearly 16.5 years to produce the inoculations. A competitive disease with a duration of one week and an R0 of 10 would require 10 weeks to produce the inoculations. While these numbers are arbitrarily chosen, they illustrate the way linear vaccine production and exponential disease spreading could possibly scale. To see this from another point of view, consider the number of inoculations produced per week for the two models. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist for the World Health Organization, believes an optimistic scenario is a vaccine produced in the tens of Millions in 2021, as quoted by Ars Technica. In addition to the time required for protection, these models also differ vastly in the type of resources required from the World’s health-care systems. A competitive disease propagation model literally replaces the bioreactors and purifiers from the vaccine factories with people. It replaces the world-wide transportation and distribution systems with people. The impact of this difference in countries with weaker health-care systems is enormous. A competitive disease propagation model works with the resources we have. A Competitive Disease would need to meet a few Goldilocks requirements. It must have sufficiently mild symptoms to minimize direct harm to people. It must be sufficiently contagious to spread rapidly through the World’s population. It must then convey sufficient protection against COVID-19 to make COVID-19 no longer an overbearing threat to humanity. Shane Crotty and Alessandro Sette, Immunologists at The La Jolla Institute for Immunology, as well Andreas Thiel’s team at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin both have identified the presence of helper T cells that recognize and target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The La Jolla team has detected a similar presence in approximately 50% of blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, while the Berlin team found 34% of analyzed blood samples from uninfected people also contained these helper T cells. The La Jolla researchers speculate these helper T cells were triggered by past infection with one of the other four coronaviruses that cause colds. One or more these four common cold coronaviruses could be candidates for a competitive disease. The infectiousness of a pathogen can vary greatly with the behavior of a host. Just as social distancing and isolation can reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19, a cooperative effort between infected and uninfected people could boost R0 enormously. For a common cold type disease with respiratory droplet transmission, an R0 of 10 or even 100 is not out of the question. There are a range of possibilities. One method might be using throat swabs from an infected to an uninfected person. Another method might be for an infected person to intentionally cough on another, perhaps coughing into an open mouth or while the other person is inhaling. At the scale discussed herein, the question is how could anything not go wrong? The following is a short list of things that could go wrong and some possible mitigations. Expanding this list and mitigating these problems is a crucial part of making a competitive disease model ethically, morally and practically possible. Mitigating this risk will require testing, monitoring and tracking. This is a massive quality control issue that must be carefully addressed. As above, this is a massive quality control issue. One approach would be to isolate the desired disease and seed populations around the World. From there the disease can be spread from human to human. The smaller the infection hot spots are, the fewer diseases we inadvertently carry along. We are fortunate that coronaviruses mutate at a lower rate than other human pathogens, such as influenza. Maximizing R0 and minimizing the size infection hot spots would both reduce the number of and risk from mutations. The idea is to keep the family tree of the disease as wide and as flat as possible. Mutations are most significant on long paths from the root to the leaves of the tree. Perhaps we should call this “Flattening the Tree”? Seeding populations with the competitive disease allows a tradeoff between the performance and risks of the two models. At one extreme, large hot spots provide the pure competitive disease model, with its higher risks and higher speed. At the other extreme, small hot spots provide the lower risks and lower speed of the vaccination model. Using an existing disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, endemic to the population, with mild symptoms simplifies some of the moral and ethical challenges. We are not releasing an unknown pathogen. We are, however, intentionally increasing the probability of people’s exposure. Weighing the pros and cons of such a proposal should consider that spreading an existing disease is a lesser risk to the population than letting COVID -19 continue along its course until a vaccine can be produced and distributed in sufficient quantities. We need to confirm the assumed safety and efficacy of such an approach with one of the common human coronaviruses. We need to quantify the logistics requirements. There are vulnerable groups that must be protected, just as there are with COVID-19. But the potential costs and savings in human lives requires attention. A discussion between people and teams who have the potential resources and interest in this model should begin. Please consider this proposal and share your comments on the challenges and opportunities presented by a Competitive Disease Model for protecting humanity from COVID-19. , Ars Technica, 25 May 2020, Hannah Kuchler. , ScienceMag.org, 14 May 2020, Mitch Leslie. , . To be sure, as you said, there are massive ethical considerations here. However, even the science of fighting this disease by forcing T-cell responses to another disease feels like there's more to lose than gain. I don't even have an issue with anything you've written here. On the contrary, you present a carefully worded and nuanced proposition. My only problem with any such course is the frustrating unpredictability of the COVID-19 immune responses. That being said, again, this is well written and lends plenty of weight to the potentially life-threatening ramifications involved. Well written and well thought out.  I appreciate your background especially you being an Applied Mathematician, I feel this adds substance and credibility to your thesis.  I also agree with MMohammed regarding some ethical hurdles but your proposal of utilizing the T cells is a method of incorporating existing interactions within the human body allows for faster remediation... worldwide. Just curious about the 8 amino acids or peptides in the spikes?  Or the Nsp5 inside the structure of the virus? Hi... I don't know what specific part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was the target of the T cell activity. So I can't say whether it was even to the spike at all, or more specifically to any particular part of the spike. The only data that I have seen is that blood samples from 30% or more of people (that had not had COVID-19) had T cell activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The researchers speculated that perhaps this was from exposure to one of the four common cold coronaviruses. It is not known if an immune response, T cell activity, to SARS-CoV-2 means that an individual has some degree of imunity to to COVID-19. If an individual has some immunity, it is not known how much. I personally think that any amount of immunity would be beneficial. I think that seriously ill patients are in a race to develop an acquired imune response before their inate immune response causes too much damage to their lungs and other organs. This is something that requires further research. If it turns out that exposure to one of the four comon cold coronaviruses give some immunity, that would be good news; good news for the alternative approach I hypothesized and good news for everyone who has previously had a common cold from the right coronavirus. I hope this helps. I don't know anything more specific. Karl"

I came across this very interesting idea to deal with the pandemic, though I am not sure if this can be implemented practically. So basically the guy is saying that if we do a coordinated 14 days global lockdown( all nations, entire humanity together), then the pandemic can potentially end in 14 days instead of going on for months and months. as those infected will be healed, or maybe die, and there will be minimal new cases. The theory sounds good though, but medical professionals might be able to throw more light on this. You can view the original idea here - 100% makes sense to slow  this down on a global scale. But you currently have people all over the globe still not taking it seriously.. The Uk and India will have the highest numbers in four weeks Yes, people are just taking it so casually. I wonder why they dont forsee what it will be just a few weeks? In Australia, people were flocking to bondi beach. In US, youngsters are partying into spring break! No one wants to take responsibility It would be nice to have a lockdown like this, but impractical, because people would disobey and some people may not have enough food and money to get food to tide them over until the lockdown is over. A full global lockdown for a few weeks is g to eliminate the virus (because no one is contagious a few weeks after they're infected), but you need governments to coordinate and enforce, and the public to comply.  People would need to stay in their homes, except for provision of essentials like food and medical care for those who really need it.  The sooner the lockdown, the sooner the problem would be solved, and the lower the economic impact.  Unfortunately, partial and intermittent lockdowns over long periods of time seem to be where we're headed, which isn't as a good a solution, because it allows the virus to continue to spread. Yes I agree. It can be difficult to implement, but the times are calling for it. India finally goes into a 21 day lockdown . NZ and Australia also in lockdowns. Now 193 nations more to go. I think it has the potential to stop the spread and consequent new cases, but I can't even get my little community to agree that the only way is the scientific method.  There is no miracle.  We can't set a date that it will end.  But we could all donate 2 weeks; if not to save ourselves, to save someone else.  We can't even get the US to listen to the WHO much less get the UN to all agree.  I'm already into week3 and I'll keep on as long as it takes. People are still taking this pandemic so casually. US wants to reopen by easter. No wonder the cases there are skyrocketing Yes....I live in the southern US and it's about to get really bad here.  I've started doing my grocery shopping at 9 at night and I'm thankful my pharmacy has a drive through window.  At least my governor closed schools early on and is limiting people congregating.  But I think the  whole country (and ideally the world as one contributor proposed) should go into lockdown . Another southern US person here.  State governor has closed public schools for the rest of the school year.  Law enforcement authorized to disperse groups of ""three or more people in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus."" (source ) had to visit the grocery store over the weekend for some supplies and drove past Lowes on the way home.  I could not believe the parking lot was overflowing and people all over the place. I drove past a local grocery chain I frequent on my way home last Thurs. and the parking lot was so full I could not have found a place to park.  It was about 4PM when I passed.  I had picked up some grocery items including shelf stable milk from a Dollar Tree  (great source, btw).  Not a lot of people at the DT; all at the grocery chain I guess.  I'll go to the grocery chain one county over at 9PM.  I'm getting a store of frozen vegetables since they are closer to fresh.  Love dried beans and grains (I'm a country girl).  And don't forget the cornbread.  Happy hunting, y'all. The idea of isolation is not to get rid of the virus but to stop the exponential rise of the spread. It will not outright destroy the virus. Hospital beds, doctors and nurses are a limited source and without a cure those beds; similar to the events during the SARS outbreak, will overfill. This just worsens the spread. The secondary reason is preventing a higher death toll before the vaccination is found for those who are susceptable to the virus like elderly and people that have heart conditions.  It's also interesting that euro-Asian countries are the most affected while in south american and african genomes, it seems to have a slower development pace But has anyone heard of the patient who was infected and contagious for around 50 days? I would like some of your thoughts and feedback on that..that scares me Scares me too if it's true.  I haven't heard of this.  Post more if you hear more. 50 days? Havent heard anything like this.

I wonder if the US will ever go into lockdown. World wide cases are 1.4 Million +. It feels like the virus is here to stay. I wish they had implemented global lock-down earlier, instead of waiting forever.  Now the window is fast closing I'm afraid US economy will collapse if Trump implements the global lockdown. The aftermath of the economic crisis can be even more destructive than Сoronavirus outbreak. Look, you've posted this in 10 threads. Stick to one, please, because having to scroll through the same message 10 times  to read the forum is annoying. You already made your own thread about this, please don't crosspost to all the other ones too. I watched the video and the gentleman's idea would be a start but getting all countries to agree would be akin to herding cats. Covid-19 has an incubation period ranging from 1 day to 29 days according to the World Health Organisation(WHO) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) but this would just need some adjustment if this could be implemented. The US was the last to impose lockdown and despite having the highest level of infection China's dubious reporting of cases notwithstanding), is among the first to consider relaxing some restrictions - see above for cat herding. India's government invoked lockdown with a six hour warning leaving over a million migrant workers stranded, without transport as this was shut down, and without money as eveything was on immediate lockdown.  Seeing a video of these poor, desperate and forgotten people was the saddest thing I have ever seen and were so obviously never even considered by their inhumane government until videos of them massing together for the very slim chance of transport back to their home villages. Some middle eastern countries rely on migrant workers under the kafala system.  These workers are forced to live together in cramped, unsanitary conditions with no rights to return home, change jobs or obtain simple things such as alternate accommodation without express permission from their ""employers"".  Amnesty International has likened the kafal system to modern day slavery.  These workers, these poor people have no option but to remain locked down in virtual prisons, some under close guard.  I hope but I fear what may happen to these poor souls. Just three areas which immediately sprang to mind. Yes a lovely idea but we don't live in a lovely world my friend."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/are-masks-really-effective-against-covid-19.2326/,Are masks really effective against COVID-19?,"We were told from the CDC earlier this year that only N95 masks will protect us from COVID-19, and now they are recommending we wear any type of mask or face covering to protect us. I understand that things develop and that scientists are always learning more, but I haven't heard anything that disputes their original findings (which was that the particles were too small to be protected by normal masks). Is that evidence out there? Have I missed it? I feel that this is an unnecessary recommendation, and in some cases requirement, and it's bad for people with breathing problems, claustrophobia, etc. Yes masks help the wearer from catching covid-19 A US Navy and CDC study of the USS Roosevelt crew that was infected with covid-19 showed that only 55% of those wearing masks caught covid-19 while 80% not wearing masks caught covid-19. Why is this self protection info about masks not being promoted as a reason to wear masks ? There is other useful info in the study The problem with this report is that it did not establish a causation but only a correlation. When agencies spread this type of information knowing full well (or at least they should and if they don't they should not be writing an article) that most people will not delve into the background. Bottom line, the virus is so small the face mask may slow down the virus but particles will travel through the mask, in both directions. What people do not mention is that the particles stay on the mask and the next time you adjust your mask... you now have the virus on your hand. Wearing a face mask is like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Its good to look for the flaws in any study and see what needs to be done to have a better picture so meaningful conclusions can be drawn or any misinformation can be addressed and so protection measures can be targeted and refined. That does not exclude using the correlated information currently observed to draw interim protection conclusions I agree it may be that there were some other factors that came into play - for example mask wearers could be more socially distanced by infected people or that the masks filtered enough of any inbound virus in 55% of cases to stop infection or there was a combination of effects that provide the observed increase in protection. However the US Navy covid-19 study sets out that 80% of non mask wearers caught covid-19 while only 55% of mask wearers caught covid-19. That does imply that regardless of any other factors the mask wearer does get for an unknown reason a correlated and very significantly better level of protection than a non mask wearer. Other Comments We are facing a serious situation. The US Navy study is useful because it looks at spread in a stable and issolated population and what steps are correlated with providing a lesser level of infection from covid-19. Whatever other factors need to be considered, for now we can say that mask wearers have a signicantly lower infection rate. If the aim is to lower infection rates while taking only limited measures then it seems justified to use masks in public places where contact with others happens. The question of requiring mask use is difficult and tends to get brought into the discussion about whether to not wear or wear a mask I think most people accept there are issues of cost, freedom of choice etc however for now it seems better to be cautious and take all limited steps possible to avoid spreading infection while still allowing people to circulate. The government providing free masks could be one way forward. Testing, tracking, tracing, quarantine, mask wearing, social distancing, washing hands etc and other limited protections while still allowing human cirulation are all correlated with a lower infection rate. Taiwan is a good example of this working. It is unclear what the long term consequences of covid-19 are. Will immunity develop or a vaccine be found to address the problem of how to stop the health system being swamped etc. It also seems very important to find out what the source of covid-19 is. That topic has died, despite it being an important factor in speeding vaccine develoment and understanding. When a disease breaks out finding patient zero and the source or as close as possible is certainly helpful in getting a better understanding To say that people wearing mask are better protected than people who do not wear a mask is not an arguable but to use it as a reasoning for wearing a mask is disingenuous. It is like saying those who wear Bermuda shorts at the Arctic Circle are warmer than Nudist at the Arctic Circle... therefore all of us are required to wear Bermuda shorts in order to stay warm. This is formulating an argument to support a preconceived conclusion. I understand your points and I too wish for this entire Covid-19 to go away but the proposals provided by our ""Experts"" are not solutions to eliminating the disease. There are other anecdotal stories that are polar opposite of your scenario; I am not saying anybody should develop a conclusion off of those experiences, either. So far, our ""Experts"" have lied to us and changed the entire method of how a death gets recorded.  See the below links. If these videos do not make one uneasy about this entire Covid-19 situation... nothing will.  I mean, our Agencies have changed the definition of ""cause of death"".  It is difficult to follow guidelines by these ""Experts"" when they continually move the goal posts every time a detailed explanation is provided. I am adding another link.  please compare this link to the last one I posted. The second article states something completely opposite of what the City of Chicago said they were conducting. This is one of the great problems with Covid-19... there are falsehoods all over the place even when city officials say the polar opposite of what was reported. I agree a covid-19 strategy should not be based on ancedotal evidence and there should be something meaningful to work on. Also experts and politicians have been very flawed in responding. The  value of the US Navy study is that it is not anecdotal evidence, it is just a report of actual data results from a real outbreak. The US Navy study shows wearing masks very significantly reduced the covid-19 infection rate - 80% infection in non mask wearers and only 55% infection for those using masks. The environment was not predesigned  to fit an outcome, the situation just came about including 2 deaths in the crew. I agree that the experts and politicians around the world  have not done a good job providing meaningful info or leadership on how to  deal with covid-19. They have flip flopped and in many cases politicians on all sides and many experts appear to have likely conflicts  of interests in what they promote and say. The use of masks seems to have got caught up as some sort of political indentification symbol which I do not think it should be. Different countries or parts of countries have adopted different strategies. There needs to be a plan to tackle future outbreaks of other viruses. All countries need to have that in place as a long term response which can be used again to stop the damage happening the same way again from another virus. We need to look to see which strategies have tackled covid-19 best so far and at the data that backs up those findings One of the few places that to date and from the start has effectively tackled covid-19 has been Taiwan. Taiwan had experience of SARS previously and learned from that. Based on their example the strategy that has been effective for SARS and covid-19 is test, track, trace, quarantine, social distancing as far as is possible and the use of masks. Taiwan has kepts its economy and schools open and has not been caught up in mask politics. Until something better can be shown to work it would make sense to put the same measures in place and get the economy working and people circulating. Lying is not flip flopping. Since you did not comment on the outright lying; do you agree with their lying? By the way, the Navy scenario is anecdotal, reliving a situation without the context of facts is PRIME anecdotal. The facts stated: some wore masks, some did not wear masks, those who wore masks had fewer cases of Covid-19. There is absolutely nothing else that surrounds those facts which makes your claims a derivative of the described events. There is no mention of: what type of masks, when they were donned, the activity of those who donned and did not put on a mask, what personnel caught Covid, who did not catch Covid, any of the Sailors sick prior to catching Covid-19, was there a restriction on movement when Covid was discovered, did the people who wore a mask and those who did not wear a mask experience the same conditions, and so on. The USA could have kept their economies open but the Politicians felt differently. Closing schools and the economy had nothing to do with wearing or not wearing a face mask, the government can make all of us wear a mask if it deemed it necessary. I have major reservations about the conduct of all politicians and many experts. Somethings they got right but most was very badly handled. I do not know if they lied - ie knew they were telling an untruth. I do believe many people made comments that were unsound but many believed that was the best they could do at the time. I think some experts were irresponsible and even show boating - Dr Ferguson in the UK had a very flawed model and a bad track record on predicting previous virus spreads. Dr Fauci seemed to enjoy the attention he got and made lots of different comments ranging from early 2020 comments of there being no need for a travel ban to the early China travel ban was an important step in stopping the virus. The WHO clearly had major conflicts which have been commented on I think the Swedish governments experts' approach was very clear and consistent as was Taiwans. Both followed different paths. Some of the experts seem to have been very compromised and have huge conflicts of interest being too close to the pharma business and various lobby and charity groups especially in the USA. That is a structural problem in most countries. Pharma is not properly regulated as it is too powerful and too close to the regulators, researchers and politicians The points you make about the study limitations make sense however the fact that it was a closed environment in which people with the virus circulated over a period of time makes it useful to look at when compared to taking random members of the public whose exposures to covid-19 would have far harder to determine Certainly  this was not a clinical trial it was a summary determined after the event to see what conclusions could be drawn Participants were tested for covid-19 and provided standardized info There is quite alot of detail in the study. For example it did seek to identify some other medical conditions people had and also if they shared accommodation with an infected crew member, what additional prevention measures were taken etc etc and the set out the results. It is up to the reader to draw some conclusions. ie the data shows there were higher cases of covid-19 when accommodation was shared with an infected sailor who had tested positive prior to the study. It also makes reference to 4 main flaws in the study You can read the study comments in the link below Thanks for the link... I look forward to reading it, objectively."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/the-only-weapon-we-have-against-covid-19-is-heat.1919/,The Only Weapon We Have Against COVID-19 Is HEAT,"ABSTRACT:    The only weapon we currently have against COVID-19 is HEAT.  The only difference between a mild case of this flu and a lethal case of this flu is how far down the respiratory tract it goes, with pneumonia in the lungs being the most severe.  Research shows that the optimal temperature for the replication of human based  cold/flu viruses is 33C and colder and it is normally limited to the upper respiratory tract because of the higher temperatures of the lower respiratory tract.  Research and correlation suggests that the zoonotic coronavirus that causes COVID-19 comes from an animal with a core body temperature of 40C (3C higher than humans) and indicates that the optimal temperature for replication could be as high as 35C to 36C and colder.  Although the temperature of the human lower respiratory tract and lungs is normally close to 37C, there are a number of factors that can cause it to drop low enough to allow the zoonotic coronavirus to replicate optimally and cause life threatening pneumonia.  The current objective of social distancing is to eliminate the exposure of humans to the coronavirus virus, however if you can keep the lower respiratory tract and lungs warm enough, you should be able to prevent or lessen the severity of COVID-19 if exposure does occur.   Support for this theory comes from the animal world in which the transitionary animal for the zoonotic coronavirus, the “bat”, survives this virus with a self inflicted Hyperthermic Treatment of it’s own, a flight induced fever. PROPOSAL:  The only weapon we currently have left against COVID-19 is HEAT and I don’t mean as a cure, I mean as a reduction in severity or in some cases even prevention.  The only difference between a mild case of the flu and a lethal case of the flu is how far down the respiratory tract they go, with pneumonia in the lungs being the most severe.  Research shows that the optimal temperature for the replication of the human cold viruses is 33C and colder.  The higher temperatures of the lower respiratory tract keep this virus from replicating deeper into the tract and most cold viruses are limited to the nose and throat.  It is believed that the zoonotic coronavirus that causes COVID-19 originates in an animal with a core body temperature of 40C and therefore has a higher temperature for optimal replication in the range of 36C and colder and can penetrate further into the lower respiratory tract and even into the lungs IF the temperature drops low enough.  The temperature gradient within a humans respiratory tract is dependent on three factors, your core body temperature, your ability to produce a fever and finally the temperature of the air you are breathing and how you take it in.  Human core body temperatures are generally around 37C but can go as low as 35C in seniors (making seniors automatically the most at risk to severe cases of COVID-19.  Younger healthy humans can achieve fevers safely to a temperature of 40C, while many seniors are unable to achieve a fever at all.  It is also the norm for humans these days to regularly take fever reducing medications to bring down their fevers.  The final factor of the temperature of the air we breath in is in fact a result of our lifestyle within the environment of our seasonal cold weather that we live in.  On the extreme end of a very cold respiratory tract we have cold weather athletes breathing high volumes of extremely cold air, through their mouths for extended periods of time that can bring lung temperatures low enough to damage them (frostbite has even been suggested). Not as severe but still with temperatures low enough to be in the danger zone, we have people working, commuting or taking brisk walks/runs in very cool weather for extended times and not always dressed to keep their bodies warm.  The point here is that you don’t have to be a senior, with an already low core body temperature to be susceptible to a severe case of COVID-19, if your activities cause your lower respiratory tract temperature to drop low enough to allow the replication of coronavirus in your lungs, you are going to get very sick. Take a look at the environmental conditions in Wuhan China, with outdoor markets and cold living conditions that people were working and living in.  How about Northern Italy, with the European lifestyle of going out in the cold every day to the shops exposing themselves to colder living conditions and possibly colder respiratory tracts, with a resulting mortality rate of over 10%.  How about New York, a cold spring with thousands outdoors working, commuting, exercising in the cold air driving down their respiratory track temperatures.  Take a look at Australia, just coming out of a warm summer, they still have over 5000 cases, but the warmer weather has reduced the mortality rate to less than 0.5%, people will still get sick but generally with much severe cases.  What needs to be done is the recent history of as many patients as possible to be taken to get an idea of exposure to cold.  Patient “vitals” should show patients with low body temperatures and the outcomes of their illness. The idea of heat being a weapon against a virus has not escaped the animal world either. The following is a Veterinarian Article that suggests that the body temperature of many species of bats while flying is likely high enough to reduce virus replication and allow bats to better survive viral infections. Bat Flight and Elevated Body Temperatures Canale and Henry “The heat of fever forestalls pathogen replication and increases the efficiency of the immune responses. Such body warming is associated with shortened disease duration and improved survival in most animals.” Although fever has been associated with improved recovery, very little is known about mechanisms, including whether the impact involves thresholds or average rates of immune response. During fever, mammalian core body temperatures can vary but typically are 38°C–41°C (14). The high metabolic demands of bat flight results in core body temperatures that commonly reach the ranges of core temperatures typical of fever. High body temperatures during flight have been demonstrated in multiple species of bats within several families and such high body temperature ranges increase the rate of multiple immune responses in mammals, including components of the innate and adaptive immune systems.  Daily high body temperatures thus might arm bats against some pathogens during the early stages of infection.” All the evidence is there, the only way to fight this Coronavirus without a viable antiviral drug or vaccine is HEAT. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP YOUR BODY AND YOUR RESPIRATORY TRACT AS WARM AS POSSIBLE. STAY INSIDE WERE THE AIR IS WARM TO BREATH, DO NOT TAKE FEVER REDUCING MEDICATIONS, TURN UP THE HEAT ON RESPIRATORS, EXPLORE HYPERTHERMIC TREATMENT, ANYTHING THAT WILL PREVENT YOUR LUNGS FROM GETTING COLD ENOUGH TO ALLOW REPLICATION OF THE CORONAVIRUS. I've always questioned the use of aspirin, etc. to reduce a fever when heat is a part of the body's defense.  With no known remedies to this new virus, I was speculating that if I were to get it and have to remain at home, perhaps I'd use my mother's old remedy of mustard plasters on my chest and back whenever I'd get a bad case of bronchitis as a child.  Is heat on the chest being used anywhere? Can I have a link to the Bat Flight quote? not that I doubt it is a real quote, just interested in the article or paper. Or you could just drink a lot of water. Negative. Ozone. And some other things. But I prefer to see the population reduced. Fear and heartache cause people to do the most innovative things. s.livescience.com/threads/the-only-weapon-we-have-against-covid-19-is-heat."

The 3 co-chairs select the panel members who set out the Covid-19 treatment guidelines for the USA 8 members of the panel have currently declared financial links to Gilead the maker of Remsedivir - one treatment the CDC  has promoted for use against Covid-19 (though some trials have been stopped and limited benefits shown) In March 2020 - 9 Covid-19 panel memebers declared financial connections to Gilead. 2 more Covid-19 panel members are said to be or have been on Gilead advisory bodies with financial connections which they are now not required to declare if there is no financial connection to the advisory aboard For example in Dec 2018 a CDC financial link was declared to the Gilead Advisory Board by Judith Aberg Gilead (Advisory Board, Research Support) This Advisory Board link is no longer required to be reported as it is over 11 months old and has no financial link associated with it despite reporting other Gilead financial links CDC - Dec 2018 Gilead Advisory Board From the above CDC finacial disclosure it can clearly be seen that the Covid-19 co-chairs are on other important treatment panels working closely with many Gilead financially linked board advisors and researchers.

CONCERNS The CDCs relationship with big pharma is too close particularly at the level of reserchers and decision makers and the revolving door of jobs between the CDC and big pharma. CDC researchers and others own CDC funded patents Further info at the end of this post about these conflicts Dr Fauci owns 8 CDC funded patents and Dr Clifford Lane owns 4 and both receive annual payments from these patents. After licensing the commercial rights to these Fauci/Lane patent treatments to drug maker Chiron Corp., (later bought by  Norvartis) Fauci’s CDC division subsequently spent $36 million in taxpayer money testing the treatment on patients in one experiment alone. Dr Clifford Lane is one of the 3 key co-chairs of the CDC Covid-19 Guidance Panel. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and NIAID Deputy Director H. Clifford Lane since 1997 received royalties of $45,072.82 each for the development of interleukin-2, an AIDS treatment they invented with NIH physician Joseph Kovacs. Other Countries Similar Gilead conflicts have been highlighted and reported in France amongst leading French Drs - see link to paper submitted for peer review below The paper sets out a review of payments made by Gilead to 98 leading French Drs correlated with how they did not support the use of Hydroxychloroquine in France - which is seen as an alternative to Remdesivir. Note only 13 of these 98 French Drs did not declare a financial connection with Gilead. A. the 13 Drs who received the biggest financial payments from Gilead were publically most strongly against the use of Hydroxychloroquine in France - high correlation B. the 13 Drs who received no payments from Gilead most were strongly in favor of the use of Hydroxychloroquine in France - high correlation See links below Emmy Award Winning Journalist Interviews CDC Official Financial Conflict Disclosure with Gilead French Gilead Financial Conflict Paper Further Info on CDC Funded Patents and Conflicts Over many years Congress, the Inspector General of Health and Human Services, Whistleblowers and Journalists have reported huge failings in transparency and conflicts of interest at the CDC. Little seems to have changed over the years  as confirmed by whistleblower disclosures etc. Its long overdue to have full transparency with disclosure of all historic payments and relationships made (not time limited) - the pharma company should have these records One physician who voted to recommend the rotavirus vaccine on the FDA’s advisory committee received $255,000 per year in research funds from the maker of the vaccine, Wyeth Lederle. She received a waiver from the FDA to vote on the issue because her research for Wyeth focused on other vaccines. One member of the CDC’s advisory committee who was not allowed to vote on the rotavirus vaccine because of a conflict was allowed to participate in closed-door working group meetings that drafted the committee’s recommendations for the vaccine. He was also allowed to make an impassioned plea for approval of the vaccine at the full committee meeting. Another member of the CDC’s advisory committee held a lucrative patent on a rival rotavirus vaccine under development by Merck. Despite this conflict, the doctor voted three times on recommendations regarding Wyeth’s vaccine. It was not until the committee voted to rescind its recommendation of the rotashield that he recused himself because of a “perception of conflict.” CDC members  own  numerous patents associated with vaccinations and regularly receive funding for their research work  from the very same  pharmaceutical companies who  manufacturer  vaccinations which are ultimately sold to the public. This situation creates an obvious conflict of interest, as  members of the  ACIP  committee  benefit financially every time a new vaccination is released to  the market. CDC members also own other medical patents paid for by CDC funds  and then used or bought by big pharma . In 2005 387 then current members of the CDC were receiving royalty payments for work funded by the CDC and 51 were doing research on patients involving patents they had developed. Another 500 + ex CDC memebers were also receiving royalty payments. See link below about Gilead drug GS-441524 GS-441524 could compete with Gileads other Covid-19 drug Remdesivir as a cheaper and possibly better treatment for Coronavirus and Covid-19 - but probably much less profitable for Gilead Some researchers thus argue GS-441524 could have been sidelined for commercial reasons. A recent open letter written to Gilead and the FDA asks why there has been no research encouraged on a potentially promising Covid-19 treatment, which had in animal testing a 96% cure for an otherwise fatal cat coronavirus FIP plus was shown to be effective against MERS and SARS. Some say research has been blocked as Gilead refused to allow the drug to be made as a treatment of cats despite it being a life saving cure. The FDA response is set out in the link below.  There is also other background info and published research on GS-441524, this research has been available for many years. The FDA now says GS-441524 will be studied as a Covid-19 treatment as the letter and the existing research have merit. Gilead was not clear on what they will do and has to date not co-operated with the Texas University researchers who have for months tried to move the public research forward and asked for all Gileads research to be made available to medical researchers. Please review the previous post and the link above on Gileads sideline Coronavirus drug GS-441524 may be better than remdesivir Below is data on Gileads lobbying spending in 1st Q of 2020 which has reached record levels - posted below Gilead Sciences, the drugmaker behind the experimental COVID-19 treatment remdesivir, spent more on lobbying Congress and the administration in the first quarter of 2020 than it ever has before, according to federal filings. The pharmaceutical company spent $2.45 million on lobbying in the first three months of the year, a 32% increase over the $1.86 million it spent in the first quarter of 2019. The first quarter is also when Congress drafted and passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which contained numerous provisions affecting the pharmaceutical industry, including funding for the development of vaccines and treatments in response to the pandemic. Early drafts of the legislation included a provision stipulating that COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests be affordable if they were developed with taxpayer funds. But the final bill included additional language that undercut that requirement. The lobbying spike also coincided with Gilead's ramping up clinical testing of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that has become the most closely watched COVID-19 treatment under development. the Food and Drug Administration authorized the emergency use of remdesivir for patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19. The agency's decision came two days after results from two significant remdesivir trials became public. ""The data shows that remdisivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery'' from COVID-19, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, about a study his institute sponsored. He said the drug would become ""the standard of care."" The same day, however, a study by Chinese researchers published in The Lancet found remdesivir didn't do better than a placebo when treating seriously ill COVID-19 patients on such measures as survival and time to clinical improvement."
