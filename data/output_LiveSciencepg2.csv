As ILCs and T cells have many redundant functions, targeting and neutralizing their effector cytokines might be a better option. Alternatively, targeting their upstream activating mediators (IL-23, IL-1B, or IL-6), or their survival factors (IL-7) could be used as an approach to treat inflammatory diseases. The epithelium comprises a physical barrier, which together with the mucus layer and production of anti-microbial peptides provides a containment barrier, which confines microbes in the lumen. The innate lymphoid cells residing in the immune compartment of the lamina propria, which is a thin layer of connective tissue that forms part of the moist linings known as mucous membranes or mucosa, which line various tubes in the body, such as the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract, are key early warning sentinels detecting invading pathogens through conserved pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors. Pathogen detecting populations, include cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which engulf and process microbial antigens and present the antigens to adaptive immune cells, thus providing initial signals to adaptive immune system lymphocytes to engage potent antigen-specific T and B cell responses. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are distributed throughout the human body in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but are especially enriched at the mucosal barrier surfaces, where they directly interact with a number of different cell types; hematopoietic or other . ILCs have lymphoid-like morphology, but lack any antigen-specific receptors. Arising from a common lymphoid progenitor and similarly to T cells, they can be further subdivided into phenotypically and functionally distinct populations that produce different combinations of effector cytokines to mediate their functions. Their development depends on different transcription factors, which are also used to help divide ILCs into 5 main groups; group 1 ILCs that includes Natural Killer cells, as well as the non-cytotoxic ILC1s, group 2 ILCs or ILC2s, group 3 ILCs including ILC3s, group 4 containing lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and, group 5 are regulatory ILCs or ILCregs. The production of Interleukin-5 (IL-5) by ILC2s in the lung leads to eosinophil recruitment, and other cell populations interact and shape the presence of lung ILC2s in airway inflammation. In addition, they also promote proliferation of B cells. It seems, that the increase in ILC2s present correlates with the severity of inflammation in the lungs, intestines, kidneys and other organs of patients suffering from severe COVID-19, and evidence confirms some ‘immunogen- experienced’ ILC2s persist after the resolution of the initial inflammation, portraying similarities to memory T cells. So, people who have been previously exposed to other coronaviruses may carry some some ""Immunogen-experienced"" ILC2s in the in the immune compartment of their lamina propria, that can provide at least partial protection against SARS-CoV-2. I intend to support my thesis, that the primary obligatory weapon against SARS-COV-2 is our highly complex and ancient, innate immune system, and not the simple, modern adaptive immune system. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Activation of the innate immune system is initiated by soluble pathogen pattern recognition molecules, which may be expressed on innate immune cells, bound to the extracellular matrix, or circulate in the blood as soluble molecules. One such soluble pathogen pattern recognition molecule is MBL (Mannose-Binding Lectin), which plays an important role in the body's immune response by attaching to foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or yeast and turning on (activating) the complement system, which is one of the most important component of the innate immune system. In the lung, MBL is found in the bronchial alveolar lavage of healthy individuals and also on the smooth muscle in airways following infection. MBL deficiency can be caused by inherited gene defects, which have been identified in 5%–30% of the world population. There are three coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at codons 52, 54 and 57, termed the C, B, and D alleles respectively. MBL-deficient hosts (those who contain C and D alleles also---the Caucasians) may present with systemic infection involving multiple organs, including blood (bacteremia), and . Such infection and subsequent cytokine release may establish an autocrine loop which further escalate complications. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, make up 30 per cent of the NT's population in Australia. In the Northern Territory, Aboriginal people are often over-represented in the health system — but it's a different story for COVID-19, with official data indicating there have been no Aboriginal coronavirus patients in the NT to date. Key points: 1) There have been just 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NT. 2) And, no community transmission. AMSANT's John Paterson was ""surprised"" no Aboriginal people in the NT had tested positive. Conclusions: 1) Austronesian genes of this aboriginal population carry some Denisovan admixture, which protects them from catching and transmitting the virus. 2) Their 30% population in the Northern Territory, has given the whole territory, a herd immunity like effect. . 3) The ancestors of Austronesians were the Hunter gatherers, who bred and assimilated (or were assimilated by) the earlier Paleolithic Australo-Melanesian Negrito, Orang Asli, and Papuan populations in the islands at varying levels of admixture. They reached as far as Rapa Nui, Madagascar, and New Zealand at their furthest extent, possibly also reaching Canada and Greenland. Giving all the pre-existing populations at these places some Denisovan genes. 4) The Pseudo- herd immunity like effect, which we see in China, was due to secondary transfer of Denisovan genes attained by south China farmers, getting transferred to North upto Mongolia and northeast Russia, and west, Upto Tibet and Uzbekistan. Directly by the mother population or through secondary crosses of the progeny populations. Some of which will be listed in my later posts regarding innate resistance of some human populations to COVID-19 disease at the individual as well as, population level (by virtue of they being, poor spreaders, of the disease). Some Denisovan gene admixture in a population, protects it's members from Covid-19 caused severe illness and death. Members of these populations are also, less infective to others. A good example are the indigenous people of Papua New Guinea. Look at China.There the hunter gatherer populations crossed with farming populations 5000 to 10,000 years ago. This supplied a great chunk of their population with some Denisovan genes. Now it looks, as if, China has already achieved some pseudo- herd immunity. Though only a negligible percentage of their 1.7 billion population got infected, and, with negligible number of deaths in ratio to their population. The same is true for other ethnic populations of those south east asian countries, which were not additionally populated by later migrations of farming/trading communities from the middle east. Example: Compare the infection and death rates of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which share borders. Data: Based on his genetic studies of the Denisova hominin, an ancient human species discovered in 2010, Svante Pääbo claims that ancient human ancestors of the Melanesians interbred in Asia with these humans. Indigenous Fijians made up only 56.8 percent of the population, 37.5 percent were Indian and the remaining groups including Chinese made up 5.7 percent.Apr 28, 2009 Different populations contain different amounts of Denisovan genes. This should be taken into account. Hundreds of ethnic populations are there in Indonesia, some interacted for a longer time and more with austronesians and some, not at all. Depending on this, the distribution of Denisovan genes by the Austronesians took place. Too mixed populations can confuse. As on 15 May There have only been 18 confirmed cases, Out of which 15 have recovered and no deaths have occurred in Fiji. It is yet another example of Pseudo-Herd Immunity, bestowed on the total population by the aboriginal population. Study shows COVID-19 vulnerability is highly dependent on host genetic architecture - Humans and viruses have evolved together for millennia, resulting in genetic polymorphisms that guide the host responses to viral infection. Consequently, clinical variation in COVID-19 severity and symptomatic presentation may be a result of differences in host genetic factors related to the immune response. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. “When you look at the health disparities in Indian Country — high rates of diabetes, cancer, heart disease, asthma and then you combine that with the overcrowded housing situation where you have a lot of people in homes with an elder population who may be exposed or carriers — this could be like a wildfire on a reservation and get out of control in a heartbeat,” said Kevin Allis, chief executive of the National Congress of American Indians. During the Spanish Flu: Considering the conditions that made them vulnerable, the researchers said, Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Native American, older people and men dying more.. among the cases for which race and ethnicity are known, according to data released by the Arizona Department of Health Services.

Nunavut COVID-19 Case Update May 18/20 Confirmed cases=0 Probable cases=0 PUI cumulative total=948 PUI currently under investigation=261 *PUI (Persons Under Investigation) includes all individuals that meet the national PUI definition as well as some others self-monitoring or self-isolating. *Please note: Every effort is made to keep this list up-to-date and complete but it may not reflect all individuals tested. Please keep that in mind when reviewing this information. This may help to get an idea of what got distributed some Denisovan genes by huntergathers in paleolithic Asia and upto some other regions of the world: This suggests that farming in East Asia could have spread through mixing of farmers and hunter-gatherers, says Ling Qin, an archaeologist at Peking University in Beijing. That’s different from what ancient-genome studies have found in western Eurasia, where farmers with Middle Eastern ancestry largely replaced hunter-gatherers in Europe. Most present day populations are highly interbred. Most clear results may be seen only in isolated ethnic groups. And, whose genomes have changed luckily little, with time (not lost the most important parts of their Denisovan content). Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Ancient genomics is recasting the story of the Americas’ first residents. Trove of DNA from prehistoric inhabitants reveals that the continents’ early settlers moved far and fast. Ewen Callaway. The Montana baby, known as the Anzick boy, belonged to a population known as the Southern Native Americans, who are most closely related to present-day Indigenous populations from South America. They split from Northern Native Americans, who are genetically closer to many contemporary groups in eastern North America, around 14,600–17,500 years ago. scientists established this year by sequencing the genome of 11,500-year-old human remains from Alaska. Another lingering mystery surrounds a 2015 discovery, made independently by both Reich’s and Willerslev’s teams, that Reich posited that this commonality points to a hitherto unknown migration to the Americas that vanished from all but the most isolated groups in the Amazon. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. ""Although not present in the sequenced Denisovan genome, the distribution pattern and divergence of HLA-B*73 from other HLA alleles (involved in the immune system's natural killer cell receptors) has led to the suggestion that it introgressed from Denisovans into modern humans in West Asia."" I presume these modern humans were ancestral Austronesians who migrated along the sea coasts to south and southeast Asia, Australia, NewZealand, Oceania. In south China they transferred the Denisovan genes to the farming communities which later, secondarily spread it to North china, Tibet, Mongolia, Taiwan, Japan and to the Americas. Though dilution of this genetic engrossment would have taken place, still, the important point is, that AS, They serve to contain viral infections by secreting Interferon Gamma, while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that can clear the infection. The next wave of modern humans from west Asia (the second wave of ancestral Austronesians injected into west Asia by the Sahara pump), which reached to settle in south-east Asia, did not contain the Denisovan engrossment in their genomes, because it had become extinct by then. Note: Neanderthal and Denisovan are cousins. Neanderthal was moved towards Europe and Denisovan moved towards Asia. At some places they crossed. And at some places all three (third being modern man) Crossed. There was a fourth hominid too which crossed, about whom we only know from genetic engrossment, no fossils have been found. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. The only way to stop the common cold & presumably Covid 19 is to take massive doses of vitamin C, along with vitamin D3 & Zinc.  The Zinc, according to reports, prevents the Virus from replicating.  The vitamin C & D3 build your immune system. My formula for heading off the common cold is 5000 mg at first sign of the cold & then 1000 mg per hour thereafter till symptoms subside.  Then from there I taper off till it is obvious that the cold has gone.  Interesting is that one time I had an appointment to have a root canal.  Well, after all the vitamin C the tooth was no longer sensitive.  It was 5 years before it bothered me again. This time it was just capped.  So if you are going to have a root canal - try the vitamin C routine. My opinion - root canals are a dental rip-off. You might try the vitamin C routine for the Covid 19 infection. I would take even more of the Vitamin C tho.  They say to bowel tolerance - which you will notice as diarrhea. But take the Zinc & D3.  Betting you can beat it.  Vitamin C will cure anything - even cancer & heart disease.  Research  ""Vitamin C Cures Cancer"" . We need very isolated ethnic groups, since a long time, for this purpose. I have selected some countries which are suitable for such a study. They also mark the movement of Denisovan genes. China, Cambodia, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, Madagascar, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Australian Northern Territory, Uzbekistan, Taiwan, Burundi, Botswana, Rawanda, Fiji, Namibia, Bhutan, Northeast India, Chattisgarh in India, Myanmar, Thailand, South Korea. The death % from total confirmed cases of Covid-19 in these countries is very low and recovery rates very high. Eastern region of Russian federation, New Zealand- Suburban and non- Urban (Maoris plus other Austronesian aboriginals), Myanmar (non- Rohangiya), Aboriginal Japanese, Aboriginal Thais, Aboriginal Chinese, Aboriginal Koreans, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, Belarus, Madagascar, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Australian Northern Territory, Uzbekistan, Rawanda, Uganda, Fiji, Namibia, Bhutan, Northeastern Indian states and Sikkim, Ladakh,Chattisgarh, Odisha, Bihar, Tamilnadu, Uttarakhand, Goa, Andman, Nicobar, Jharkhand-- all in India, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, UAE, Oman, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Ghana, Guinea, Gabon, Djibouti, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, Maldives, Venezuela, Equatorial Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Hong Kong, Ethiopia, Zambia, Costa Rica, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Palestine, Taiwan, Reunion Island, French Guiana, Eswatini, Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, French Polynesia, Macau, Bhutan, Eritrea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Timor-Leste, Grenada, New Caledonia, Saint Lucia, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Falkland Islands, Greenland, Seychelles, Saint Barthelemy, Anguilla, Lesotho. The death % from total confirmed cases of Covid-19 in these regions is low (0-1%) and recovery rates very high as compared to global trends. Note: in few of the above places people with non Denisovan genetic engrossment are also having having high innate immunity due to some other ancient genetic engrossments. The lifespan of animals which got infected with SARS-COV-2 is comparatively very less in the wild. Similarly the ancient hunter gatherer hominins reached puberty at a comparatively very less age than modern humans. The most aged, only a single skeleton, found till date of a modern man of 40,000 year ago, was found to be of just 40 years of age, which was severely arthritic. Most skeletons found are of teen age or younger. Also in those times the population density was very less and so infectious disease burden was very less. So, probably adaptive immunity was of less survival value than innate immunity. From the above information it seems logical to deduce that the Denisovan genetic engrossment, somehow bestows an enhanced innate immunity. And SARS-COV-2 seems more susceptible to innate immunity than adaptive immunity. List is not comprehensive and final. Additions and deletions with time are expected to refine the gene transfer points by Ancestral Austronesian hunter gathers, and also their secondary transfer to other populations. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Highlights of age and genetic reasons which caused COVID-19 fatalities in USA: Out of the total 103,379 deceased (1) 23,777 African Americans lost their lives. Mainly due to a genetic variant found exclusively in African Americans, that gets expressed during COVID-19 caused hypoxia. Hypoxia induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) contributing to the higher COVID-19-related mortality seen exclusively in ""African Americans"". (2) Elderly population of USA was 52.512 million. They were more susceptible to COVID-19 caused death due to Comorbid conditions. The population of NZ on the other hand is not even 5 million. (3) Currently 1million people are over the age of 90 years in US. (4) Since progestins in doses which prevent bleeding can increase the risk of thrombosis five to six fold, 32% of European American women who have inherited the progesterone receptor from Neanderthals (which in normal circumstances tends to prevent miscarriages and helps in giving birth to more children) were more likely to suffer from serious Covid-19 complications. (5) Unlike China, Russian Federation, Vietnam, NZ, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Australian Northern Territory, Mongolia, Belarus, Taiwan, Tibet, Papua New Guinea, Madagascar, Srilanka, and many other regions listed by me previously, there was a dearth of people with Denisovan genetic engrossment in the population of USA. Which if present around 30% in a population give the population a Pseudo Herd Immunity. I repeat, that this engrossment boosts the innate immunity, through NK cell secretions of Interferon Gamma and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, thus quarantining the cells long enough not only giving time for adaptive immunity to develop but TNF-ALPHA is directly SARS-COV-2 CIDAL. It is therefore my prediction, that non of the vaccines currently being developed will help enough, until some factors for boosting the NK cell secretions directly or through cytokine stimulus produced from tissue resident macrophages is/are co-linked with the vaccine. It is also possible, that just boosting the innate immune system alone can save lives as it is doing in the earliest Austronesian aboriginals. Why vaccines, drugs, monoclonal neutralizing antibodies being developed currently will not be satisfactorily effective against SARS-COV-2?? Short Answer: The naked, ""positive sense"" single stranded genome of SARS-COV-2 has the capacity of intercellular transmission via vesicles containing its positive sense SS RNAs. These vesicles then facilitate virus spread to adjacent cells ""lacking tight intercellular junctions,"" by collectively transferring multiple viral genomes into their cytoplasm. Cell lysis required to free the viruses and so come in contact with neutralizing antibodies may not always occur. The positive sense single stranded RNA does not require messanger RNA to translate itself. Only causing apoptosis of the cells containing it is a solution, which can destroy the intracellular viral RNA. This can only be achieved by using innate immune system cells. Almost the whole human body, thus can virtually act as a single cell for SARS-COV-2. In this scenario, not only the envelope surface protein neutralizing antibodies become useless, but also drugs targeting the viral RNA (like Remdesivir)would be required in doses which would be lethal for the patient. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. In light of this previous post, data has started coming in. Judge it by yourself, how the efficacy is much less satisfactory than required. (1) On Monday, Gilead Sciences announced the results from its Phase 3 SIMPLE trial, which found that hospitalised COVID-19 patients on remdesivir were 65 per cent more likely to see clinical improvement by the eleventh day compared with those who were not on the drug ( ). Remdesivir will only be used in hospital or institutional settings and said another source who is directly aware of the development. With data from: (2) Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. The above article may point to another important factor for greater death percentage of European females as compared to East Asian females when the following information is also considered: Another very important component of the innate immune system, the Natural Killer cells ( have shown no significant difference in the uterus of women with recurrent miscarriage compared with controls. However, higher peripheral NK cell percentages occur in women with recurrent miscarriages than in control groups. This prompts one to consider that a comparatively lower peripheral NK cells concentration occurs in 32% of European women who have a Neanderthal variant progesterone receptor engrossment as compared to East Asian females. If so, it implies a female organism with no Neanderthal variant progesterone engrossment is more dependent on innate immunity, and, therefore these women have a lesser probability to suffer from severe COVID-19 disease due to lesser coagulability of their blood. I intend to support my thesis, that the primary obligatory weapon against SARS-COV-2 is our highly complex and ancient, innate immune system, and not the simple, modern adaptive immune system. Any successful vaccine will have to address the involvement of the innate immune system in a large measure along with the usual adaptive immunity developing immunogens, or pathogen neutralizing antibodies. The reason for this is, that SARS-COV-2 does not require cell lysis to move from one cell to the next (as described in a previous post), and, that it has a positive sense single stranded RNA and so does not require a messanger RNA to be translated in the host cell. Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. Another case series from Iran too indicate : Seven pregnant women testing positive for COVID-19 died of cardiopulmonary complications. Nine women in the series endured a range of cardiopulmonary complications including acute hypotension, persistent hypoxia, organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac arrest. Only one recovered; besides the seven who died, one remained critically ill and on ventilator support at the time of publication. Women in this retrospective case series were not selected by any form of systematic surveillance, but were voluntarily reported cases of maternal morbidity and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. WHILE........ Initial reports on more than 150 pregnant women from China indicated only one case of severe cardiopulmonary morbidity. An easy way to mark women who have genetic engrossment with the Neanderthal variant progesterone receptor is to look for visible hairs on their limbs ( when not artificially removed). Such women are common in Europe and from Middle East to North West India. While, from North East India to East Asia, Melanesia and in the ethnicities in the countries, a list of which I have posted previously (having comparatively very good innate capacity to recover from COVID-19) such women disappear ( naturally have smooth, hairless looking limbs). Universe is a zero dimensional infinity. There are two different options for these people to reach the south of America's : 1) by Boat and arriving somewhere in Peru. See also the attached picture 2) By passing through Antartica and passing on to South America."

The authors, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, UK, said that This decrease could not be explained solely by the other restrictions and that it highlighted the impact of isolating people who tested positive and quarantining the members of their household. Harvard Medical Professor Dr Mina explains how cheap Covid-19 antigen tests could be rolled out economically on a massive scale to help bring Covid-19 under control very rapidly and possibly within 1 month as was shown in Slovakia. This strategy is already being succesfully used in certain Schools in the USA and Germany which have stayed open - see cases in link at end. PROFESSOR Mina says the FDA has failed to roll out this cheap and effective antigen testing  solution which is probably a vital way forward. The FDA is set up to deal with medical devices and not simple public health solutions Please see Harvard Research posts, media articles and short podcast with Professor Mina Summary Covid-19 antigen rapid tests take between 5 and 15 minutes to give a result are simple for anyone to administer at home certain FDA approved antigen tests are over 99% accurate can cost from a few cents to a few dollars to make. One household or work or school group can mix their test samples in one antigen test and if it gives a positive Covid-19 result they could retest with another type or style of antigen kit to confirm the result and if still positive test individually which people were infected. Quickly reducing the number of people with Covid-19 in circulation will dramatically stop the spread PCR Tests The alternative PCR tests take 5 days to get results and are both expensive and time consuming to administer and process Harvard Professor explains how antigen tests are inexpensive, simple to manufacture, easy to use, give Covid-19 results in minutes, and are extremely effective at detecting when people are most contagious with COVID-19. Although antigen tests are not as accurate as the PCR tests, Mina said that problem could be solved by requiring a second test using a different type of antigen test to confirm original results. It is highly unlikely that different types of  antigen test would also produce a false positive If enough people were provided with the tests and used them frequently, they’d know if they were contagious and could then isolate themselves to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others. Mina cited the example of Slovakia, “where massive screening has, in two weeks, completely turned the epidemic around.” He said that even if only half the U.S. population used the tests, outbreaks could still be stopped in a matter of weeks. Although antigen tests are not as accurate as the PCR tests, Mina said that problem could be solved by requiring a second test to confirm original results. He explained that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t yet authorized at-home tests because the agency typically regulates medical devices, not public health screening tools—which is how rapid antigen tests should be used. “We need to create a new authorization pathway within the FDA (or the CDC) that can review and approve the use of at-home antigen testing, without these medical-centric barriers,” he wrote. Mina, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology and Immunology, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and Associate Medical Director of Microbiology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School In the U.S. the guidelines are:  wear a mask outside; avoid crowed enclosed areas with a marked degree of people interaction, i.e.: follow local restrictions;  when feeling sick, get tested for covid-19/stay home/see a doctor; don't  travel unless necessary, and observe the local quarantine rules. These guidelines are contentious in the U.S..  However, such seems to have worked in Slovakia.  I suspect that in the U.S. economic survival and the lack of federal/ state governmental aid/alternatives/compromises is a paramount factor driving the morbidity. Covid lockdowns have not worked in other than the very short term except if you lockdown those who are ill or have been in contact with Covid We need an advanced warning system before people show symptoms of being sick to stop Covid being spread. Mass lockdowns only pause the Covid spread. Taiwan has stopped Covid with a targeted lockdown of those who had contact with Covid the country has no general lockdown Without any vaccines Taiwan has been very successful at using targeted isolation and rapid testing in stopping Covid. Taiwan has a test track trace isolate strategy which has stopped Covid Once a lockdown ends the virus starts spreading rapidly if it is anywhere in the population. Mass home work school antigen testing can be simply cheaply and easily done once or twice each day by combining multiple individual test samples into 2 distinct and different antigen testing methods. If either shows Covid the tests can be done on smaller groups until the infected are identified and all in the group must isolate and keep retesting Vaccines may not work we need a mass public health solution that stops Covid from circulating We need cheap easy to use tech that can be used in Africa and the USA etc to stop Covid otherwise the virus will probably keep coming back and is already mutating like the flu. Vaccines may not provide a solution 1 or 2 antigen testing kits can be used to quickly test a big number of people at the start of each day - say a school class - to see if anyone has the virus. Action can then rapidly be taken Only by identifying carriers before they circulate can the virus be stopped. This is basic public health strategy The curent understanding is that vaccines may only reduce the level of the infection in a person, but may not stop Covid being caught or spread by a vaccinated person. We also do not know how long a vaccine is effective even if it stops the virus spreading Mass Rapid Antigen Home or Work or School etc Testing needs to happen to see what is happening with vaccination and otherwise It provides both real time news of where the virus is and how many are infected but also is cheap easy to use and effective It also provides an alternative and parallel way forward to vaccines. Other drugs can be used to stop Covid as the medical results show which work in part or fully This strategy will not depend only on vaccines Vaccines may have only a time limited protection or may fail to stop the vaccinated from catching and spreading Covid . The Slovakian results show that antigen testing was almost certainly a key factor in getting the rapid reduction in Covid cases. The UK study of the Slovakian results says the 60% decline in Covid in one week was not explained by the lockdown measures. Its important to isolate those groups who have been in contact with an infectious person as well as the infected person That is why rapid frequent testing is critical as Harvard Professor Dr Mina has set out. Prof Mina has talked to the FDA and says the FDA are not able to act in a mass public health role and they are stuck as regulators of medical devices and medicine Mass rapid antigen testing is a public health not regulatory role. Its like asking a car mechanic to arrange a mass vehicle recall Additionally the antigen testing companies have realized they can sell 1 kit for $30 or more if paid for by insurance which can be done if the kit is approved by the FDA as a medical device They make more money this way rather than selling 6 kits for $5 and do so for less effort and investment in their own infrastructure cost These antigen kits are like pregnancy test kits or even just a simple paper test kit which detect Covid RNA or other Covid material etc. Its well tested old technology used to detect various viruses in the same simple way. Just the reaction paper needs to be modified to detect Covid.

However,  any results may be obviated due to the plethora of covid-19 mutations.  Possibly, the best global and national strategies would seem to be rapid results testing ability implementation and, most importantly,  the administration of existing and newly developed vaccines ASAP concurrently with improving and developing care protocols/medications for active covid-19 cases.  The  informational responses to the covid-19 pandemic beg the questions ""Who is at the greatest/most probable risk of long term  morbidity and mortality from covid-19""?  ""Shouldn't those most at risk receive the vaccines and/or protocols on a priority basis""?  ""Why should politicians, legislators, wealthy folks and bureaucrats not in a most at risk category get priority for any vaccine""?  N.B.:  In the U.S., covid-19 mortality overall is between 1.5% -2.0% based upon reported public data.   Risk categories and related underlying physical/mental  conditions are defined/updated. It would seem that the paraphrased public manta should be ""Full speed ahead with vaccinations/testing according to logic and damn the covid-19"". Thanks for your response. And, of course, escape mutations will continue to change the overall picture. And, if they completely evade immunity, we'd have to be thinking of them, in the most extreme case, as of a new virus. But the question remains: would the experiment which I outline generate data that is worth the limited risk (heroic's to big a word for it)? Assume a group of 100 or even several such groups in various countries. We'd have the possibility to correlate the outcomes to all the physiological parameters which we measured before and after the experiment. Do reinfections correlate with antibody levels (or other measured parameters like T-cell responses, vitamine D status, etc.)? Does immunity prevent severe disease only or does the virus never replicate to levels which would make ""immune"" Covid survivors infectious for other people? I think that the answers to these questions should be interesting and relevant enough to guide future politics. And thus I'm of the opinion that the risk should be worth taking. For me Heroic is not a big enough word.  The risk seems undefined, and to take such for the advancement of science, and the benefit of others simply prompts the blessing ""Via Con Dios""."

As I argued in my Newsweek piece: Just as we wouldn’t imagine having a plane crash and not immediately trying to figure out what happened, we can’t let the COVID-19 crisis unfold without urgently understanding how our systems have so spectacularly failed."" Anybody seriously interested in this subject should read the link below it is extremely informative Below a very short summary in Newsweek by Jamie Metzl of what is wrong with the UN WHO investigation into Covid-19 UN WHO outline document for investigation into Covid-19 Official Chinese investigation into circumstances of death of Wuhan Whistleblower Dr Li who died of Covid-19 A year plus into this pandemic, most of us who live in the U.S.  are heartened by the successful international efforts to quickly  produce and manufacture different covid-19 vaccines with marked efficacies.  Likewise, the relatively rapid distribution and prioritized  administration of these vaccines is an new historic effort.  Contentions about vaccine priorities and eligibility notwithstanding, this is a notable achievement. for the international community.  Basically such overshadows  and compensates to some  degree for the nebulous, acrimonious, blaming regarding the origin, spread and development of the pandemic.  There will be other pandemics in the future, quite possibly from extraterrestrial sources. Our ability to effectively deal with them is/will be critical to our survival and continuance as a complex, sapient species. It is absolutely true that we will face other pandemics and so it is important to investigate as soon and as fully as possible how far back Covid-19 entered the population and how it mutated. We are already seeing the need for more research into Covid-19, and that how it develops is effecting treatments. The NY Times has identified that some researchers have indicated that only one dose of vaccine should be given to people who have already had Covid-19. We know that certain vaccines can only be given to people who have already been infected with dengue fever. It may be Covid-19 vaccines have other better non standard regimes Some results on the Oxford-Astra vaccine indicate that 1/2 a dose of vaccine followed by a later full dose increases  protection. A UK minister indicated that a pill version of the vaccine may be developed later. Testing such vaccines or regimes on the earliest genetic samples yet to be found of Covid-19 may shed light on how treatment can be improved and how the virus mutations respond to the vaccine. Finding the earliest samples of Covid-19 in the human population is likely to provide key information about how Covid-19 adapted to infect people so well, which is probably central to any successful on-going treatment regime and may also provide a yet to be found weaknesses in the early versions of the virus, that can be applied to the current mutation of the virus. Steps have been taken in Europe, S. America and elsewhere - for example a Spanish University looked back to Dec 2018 for traces of Covid-19 in sewage samples with no credible traces found before November 2019. China has failed to provide such information on the historic spread of Covid-19. Such information is normal and straight forward to obtain from blood and sewage samples and a standard procedure in a pandemic or after any serious medical event in human or animal populations. China appears unwilling to share Covid-19 data prior to January 2020, though I assume like other countries it has reviewed in detail  historic samples of sewage and blood etc. Computer studies of the Covid-19 indicate the virus started sometime between Sept 2019 and October 2019, and researchers also conclude that ""no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected… In comparison to the SARS-CoV epidemic, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic appears to be missing an early phase during which the virus would be expected to accumulate adaptive mutations for human transmission"" For a virus to be able to infect a host it goes through some earlier benign mutations within the host or some other rapid evolution which leaves an earlier virus and a genetic marker To date no such virus or genetic markers have been found in any early version of Covid-19 showing an earlier human or animal existence Samples of the earliest Covid-19 virus should help researchers understanding of what has happened and with medical treatment r&d. This information could be very significant We cannot simply turn a blind eye to China not doing the normal tests and looking for the earliest detectable sample of Covid-19 in China when clearly everyone else is doing so domestically China has requested the world to look domestically for the earliest trace of the virus outside China and yet China will not take such steps internally or at least will not share what could be vital information and genetic code We know the Chinese have been looking in 2020 at old blood samples from 2012 of miners who died from an unknown SARS coronavirus. Professor Shi from Wuhan has admitted this in November 2020 and said that the 2012 samples had tested negative in 2020 for Covid-19. However she avoided saying if they tested for any general SARS virus result, this is strange because we know SARS was present in the 2012 samples - Phd research was published on the 2012 miners which showed a SARS virus was present Additionally in Feb 2020 Prof Shi said the 2012 miners died of a fungal infection and their case had no relevance to Covid-19 or coronaviruses However in the Nov 2020 Addendum to the Feb 2020 information Prof Shi admits that she and others repeatedly searched for the coronavirus that killed the miners in 2012 (and that they worked in the same location where she found RaTG13 the nearest virus currently known to Covid-19) We have also learned that Prof Shi also collected other Coronaviruses in the same 2012 miners location and that she has not disclosed or registered these genetic sequences. Further China failed to report the 2012 SARS virus outbreak, even though the current head of the Chinese CDC supervised the Phd study of the 2012 miners SARS coronavirus, and the miners Dr also wrote an MA thesis on the same 2012 miners virus and the studies both refer to a SARS coronavirus which was identified in blood and/or tissue tests by Prof Shi's colleagues in Wuhan. Given the seriousness of world events its time to put all this info into the public domain and get as many minds looking for solutions in the light (ie not with information withheld). If Canada, the USA or Germany were acting as China has done and Covid-19 first started there I am sure there would be huge criticism from around the world. Please review the link below for the supporting research referred to above and also review the other various posts I have made on this subject for links to Covid-19 research I agree with  Adam's post above; it's logical, reasonable and responsible.  For my concern, I'm focused on the immediate need(s) to treat and vaccinate against covid-19 with all of its many variants, mainly for personal reasons.   What scares me is the prospect for an uncontrollable viral disease that haunts humanity with increasing morbidity and mortality year after year.  Hysterical, culturally based ""Face Saving"", denials, and political chicanery seem to be endemic in all nations.  Thus, Locking up/ punishing/changing any pseudo ""Typhoid Mary"" seems both impracticable and impossible in today's political/military landscape.  I acknowledge the quandary: we need to determine the past,  in order to better deal with the present, and to do both to preserve the future.  It's a difficult situation to say the least. Your comments are very disturbing. Prior to this Covid-19 vaccine that was developed in less than a year, the fastest any vaccine developed and approved for use was 4 years.  This dates back to 2020 where a vaccine hadn't reached the market any sooner... not until Covid-19 came along.  This means one cannot say advances since the 1960's has made this possible because we have been using those advances since the measles vaccine was created in the 60's. I find it strange, we have not yet purified the virus and yet we have a vaccine... this is unprecedented as this vaccine should be viewed with skepticism until all the EUA's are lifted. What is even more disturbing is that the WHO reduced the Ct (cycle threshold) from 45 to 35... this alone will mathematically reduce the number of ""positive"" Covid-19 by 85-90%. To even pursue a vaccine is a complete waste of everything that is thrown into it... especially the false narrative that the vaccine will be the reason why Covid-19 will be a distant memory by the end of the summer.  Don't think the easing of restrictions in California and New York is based off of any scientific/medical reasoning... it is based off of moving the goal posts by altering the test parameters to make it appear that Covid-19 is waning in it's strength because of what you just posted. I'm as annoyed and angered, as many justifiably are, about the politically based lack of information about the origin   genetics, and spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.  Obtaining that data is an important issue, but ""down in the trenches"", I'm concerned with the present, and the future which is heartening in that vaccines can be fast tracked by several nations. What covid-19 vaccines which are now available seem to produce is a 5 month to a year+ immunity. That's a benefit for ameliorating the present pandemic spread.  Note: Whether or not vaccinated one WILL HAVE to wear a mask and social distance, which in my opinion should be 10 feet at least, for an as yet undefined time period.  As for easing the covid-19 restrictions in CA and NY, it's basically an economic decision and a real gamble.  The two states with the highest morbidity and mortality are hoping that vaccination, common sense restrictions and herd immunity will prevent a disease surge. I hope so.  Since I live in one of those states and qualify for vaccine priority, I have a vested interest in the pandemic's amelioration.  Personal opinion: covid-19 ain't going away any time soon."

Good news that the original covid-19 variant produces antibodies effective against the newly  mutated, more lethal UK variant.  However, the basic concern is still undefined.  That is, how long do the antibodies from the original covid-19 infection and/or the any of the vaccines last?  The latest estimate I read stated approx. 5 months to a year.  If that is accurate, such portends having to get a covid-19 vaccine annually, until covid-19 goes extinct or becomes non human infectious.

This thread is intended to debunk COVID-19 myths, hoaxes, untested suppositions,  and any other claims that are ""too good to be true."" There are many groups and institutions working to find it, but these things take time. When people are afraid, they are more likely to try things that are risky or untested, so we will not allow posts that claim to be a cure to remain in our forums. In this thread we'd like to hear any suspicious information that you've heard here, or elsewhere. This is not to continue the spread of questionable info, but so we can engage with the community to provide verifiable data to the contrary of these claims. We encourage all of our LiveScience forum experts to contribute their knowledge to this thread. Please make sure to cite from a secondary or primary source when debunking a hoax. With a herd mentality and the exchange of knowledge we can defeat the grifters out there trying to profit from this public health crisis. Some misinformation that we've seen and removed includes: Statements that are not proven with this strain of virus: The best way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing (keeping 6 feet/2 meters from one another or at the very least, 3 feet/1 meter from the nearest person), and to wash your hands regularly and thoroughly (20 seconds at least). While are posted to every subforum, it's good to call special attention to this specific rule here: There have been questions regarding the coming spring season and if warming temperatures will kill off the coronavirus. While historically, viruses do tend to spread more slowly in warmer weather, we won't know the full scope of change that will happen with COVID-19 yet. Sources on this are plentiful, but a few include. So the main cause of death during this outbreak is not the virus but what it leads to, Pneumonia. But there is a Vaccine against Pneumonia, addmittedly it comes in 2 parts 12 months apart but part 1 protects against the most prevelent and dangerous forms. So far I have heard no mention of this, I would have thought this would be a major line of defence especially for the most vulnerable. I am reasonably well educated in things viral and keep up-to-date regarding pathogens of fish including viruses. Certain amount of a population will be more resistant and some less so. Some may become latent carriers of the virus while others may die. Warmer weather can help people fight illness. Vitamin D is essential for proper functioning of the immune system (Aranow 2011). I've just been to the supermarket and the shelves were practically empty. People were terrified and there was an atmosphere of impending doom. Worrying can negatively affect immunity so keep calm (Segerstrom, & Miller 2004). Let it go… It is not difficult to predict the outcome. This will playout like all other pandemics. The virus will become endemic in the population. The time and place will come. Recall Norovirus. A 24-hour stomach bug. Everyone got exposed to that, vomited for 24 hours then went about their business. It is still present within the population. Babies will eventually catch it, like they will chicken pox, and like adults, will have the same symptoms. As the years pass, the symptoms of this virus will become milder (Harper 2016). If this kills you, you’ve been very unlucky but there is nothing anyone can now do. The cat is out of the bag. Everyone is powerless over the outcome. Observe good hygiene, be sensible. Look after your health. Avoid excesses in anything. Enjoy the time you have left albeit decades or days. Worrying will make you more susceptible (Segerstrom, & Miller 2004). Selfishly hoarding supermarket supplies, hand sanitiser and soap may kill some vulnerable people who need them. Chris References Aranow C. (2011). Vitamin D and the immune system. , (6), 881–886.

Please read the research papers on Vitamin Therapy as researched, documented and written by Dr. Freidrich Klenner, Duke Uni grad who practiced in NC for many years. His work  is pretty awesome. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I've heard claims and research that huge doses of vitamin C can even regress cancers. However, it cannot stop a virus from infecting you. The facts are simple, on the first encounter with a virus the body takes from 7 to 10 days to produce enough antibodies to fight the illness. Up to that point the virus has full reign to overwhelm someone. On the second encounter, within a couple decades. it should take around 2 days because of the acquired memory of the first encounter. The challenge with this virus is it has come from a bat (a zoonosis) and most human’s bodies have not encountered it before, nor anything similar. Therefore, none of us have acquired immunity. Vitamins galore won’t change that. I am very sceptical of the journal  in which thes arcticles are published. I get the impression that it is not one of the best peer reviewed journals nor does it appear to be what is considered primary scientific in nature. It is what is classed as alternative medicine which have less stringent and objective ways of measuring their data. ""I took this one day and the next the illness went away so that must be the cure."" I am fraid t is not a simple. However, I am willing to admit I am wrong if you can present me with a single objetive and statisically correct study from this journal. Chris Hi Chris, the data/research and documentation of double blind/placebo studies show that ascorbic acid creates extremely low permeability with the cell wall. It's not meant to be a cure all end all...it's meant to give the host (we humans) a better fighting chance against a novel, mammalian virus that not only can re-assort its genome but may be bi-phasic. I can cite numerous studies, without bias, on the virulence of bat vectored corona viruses but the bottom line is that the immune system is going to need all the help it can get from micro nutrients, of which our foods are lacking, and until a vaccine is approved for public use we are kind of left up to our own devices to promote our individual health in the best, and most attainable, way we can. Isolation and quarantine is necessary in order to PROTECT those among us with compromised immune systems. Those of us who are healthy, with no underlying tax on our own immunity, fare much better in being able to resolve the illness once exposed. I urge people to use common sense as they  would with any community acquired illness. Wash your hands thoroughly, keep them away from nose and mouth, don't get too close, drink plenty of water, get plenty of sleep and nourish your body as best as you can.  I think perhaps we all can agree that in addition to the fatality associated with this novel virus the second most horrible factor is that those who are ill with SARS-CoV-2 are isolated from family and friends in their last days. I honor all those in medicine and science who are working diligently to successfully treat/prevent this virus. Thank you for administering to this forum to allow an informative, hopefully, discussion on this matter. if the way that people die is that the virus interferes with oxygenation at the level of the heme molecule, might this be the reason that babies and young are so resilient despite a relatively less mature immune system? The virus has spikes that communicate with the epithelial cells in the lungs and the virus then invades the healthy cell. From what I've been reading an ACE2 antagonist action as found in Monteleukast or Symbicort, both ACE2 inhibitors, may help prevent that communication between the virus and the healthy, epithelial cell. That is the general pattern and I highly expect it is the one COV-19 will follow. To go a little farther COV-19 will probably follow the multiple wave pattern shown by Spanish Flu and most other worldwide epidemics with at least 3 waves represent exhaustion of various groups of closest regular social intimacy, then afteran all clear spread to more socially occasional and less cohesive contact in larger cities and regions - and finally to distant relatively isolated groups worldwide.  Increased travel may compress the final wave from significance. still its not researched. Not all epidemics find a mild and favorable equilibrium. Some super rare go to near extinction. Far less likely with humans as extensive viral mutation would likely be required to evade vaccines Al.though if humans were unable to maintain lengthy immune response to some virus,,,that would be a problem where vaccines and prior exposure would be marginally useful. Based on human immunity to other Corona family virus I think that unlikely in the extreme. “GIVE THEM A FEVER” The U.S. National Library of Medicine states the following: “Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.” Point 1.   500 thousand years of evolution and the most advanced complex immune system in the world “responds” to just about any respiratory infection with what, a fever and a runny nose. Point 2.  If most viruses that effect humans thrive best at 37C (human core body temperature) then we can assume that the viruses that affect certain animals thrive best at their core body temperatures. Point 3.  There are now 4 animals (pig, bird, bat and camel) that are associated with the deadliest zoonotic viruses known to man and every single one of them have core body temperatures of at least 40C. Point 4.   The human immune system can naturally safely produce a fever of up to 40C to fight most human viruses but this might might not be high enough to fight a higher temperature zoonotic virus. Point 5.   A significant number of Seniors have core body temperatures of as low as 36C and their immune systems are actually NOT CAPABLE of producing any type of fever, let alone one high enough to fight a zoonotic virus. Point 6.    The human respiratory tract experiences a huge range of temperatures both below and above 37C and is the main target of infectious viruses usually in the colder seasons when cold dry air has cooled and dried out our respiratory tracts. Point 7.    A heated ventilator, a steamer, a towel over a pot of boiled water can bring the temperature of the human respiratory tract up to as high as 46C WITHOUT significantly increasing the body core temperature and possibly be able to help our immune systems to fight against these higher temperature zoonotic viruses. EVERYTHING points to temperature, our immune system, when we get viruses, how we fight them, the coincidental temperature link of the four animals, seniors being the hardest impacted, EVERYTHING and maybe the simplest easiest and most logical treatment for CLOVID-19 is to “GIVE THEM A FEVER”. Congressional testimony in 2001 on immune protection from Biological wafare – closed door session Pg 81 – McDaniel, H. Reg, M.D. Part of his written testimony.. “In instances of unusual, epidemic and virulent infectious agent exposure, glyconutrient supplementation has been found effective for enhancing general immune function and defense. When supplied at a higher level and available in nature, sugars needed for cellular synthesis can take innate defense mechanisms to a much higher level that are effective against infectious agents. The biochemical principles responsible for this phenomenon and mechanisms of action are in your written material. Body defense, such as the mechanisms that act naturally when we recover from a common cold or influenza, can now be up-regulated to destroy virulent organisms associated with more virulent disease. Such benefit is the result of increased synthesis of SLIDE 4 cell-to-cell communication molecules that act like tiny IBM cards sent between cells to provide instructions for destroying bacteria, viruses and other infectious organisms. SLIDE 5 increasing the levels of glyconutrients in the diet increases the synthesis of these anti-infection molecules. The bar graph provided is evidence of the functional antiviral activity described. It is an example of the increase in general defense against infectious organisms that results when glyconutrients are progressively added to the diet.” HUMANS DONT HAVE CELL WALLS. WE ARE NOT PLANTS NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO BE! Also, the most relevant article i found on the Coronavirus being biphasic is from a website that also said it causes heart failure, which is not a symptom, and has this: I think Iran is not a ""wintertime"" country And this Rabbi got a medical degree where? You probably recovered despite the weird spice drink, not because of it. C'mon CLOVID-19, we were already dealing with COVID now we have a new one? Getting serious now. Fevers, runny noses, and coughs are side effects and are only the most visible ways your body is reacting. (Its 3.5 billion, don't disrespect my boys the microbes) The immune system is working hard at the cellular level too, acting like a government trying to stop the spread. (analogy time) While a cure is being developed (antibodies for the TCells to seek out) they contain it with a blood-brain barrier and trying to cough it away from the lungs. The mobilize other systems to fully contain and kill the invader, like making white blood cells. don't draw crazy conclusions please, you body is doing the best it can. in the here, in the now, people are dying. It needs to be slowed so the swamped healthcare system doesn't have to deal with cavalier idiots like you who got it because they didn't try to protect themselves and other people. My friends in medicine are going insane because of the impending workload. I may not be able to see them for months. Isn't it a ""reduculous"" that dumb people are always whining about illegal immigrants? Thank you. I am not connected with medicine but agree with all you have written and thank you for this point which I had not considered at all. We have a heated ventilator and I will try it if I get  it at a temperature that I can bear and does not burn. Please see also the research on ""flight as fever"" in bats, and ""older is colder"" (both on Google scholar) regarding the way that fever reduces with age. This video by Dr. John Campbell comes out in favour of fever and mentions behavioural influences such as wrapping up warm, shivering and sitting next to the fire as part of the way that the body achieves a fever. If wrapping up warm and sitting by a fire is part of the mechanism by which we increase our body temperature in fever, then why a hot bath would have no protective effect ( ) I have no idea. If it were me I would be wrapping those poor people in Northern Italy in electric blankets but I am not a doctor. Scratch the WHO off your list of valid sources of information. Back on January 14, they said that COVID-19 couldn't be transmitted from person-to-person. The Director is an apologist for China who have mounted a massive disinformation campaign to cover up their malfeasance and gross negligence in unleashing a plague on the world that originated in their country. They knew about the virus in November and did everything in their power to keep people from knowing about it. The eight scientists who were trying to get out warnings on social media were thrown in jail to shut them up and the doctor who first identified the virus reportedly ""died from it."" The media are also pushing Chinese propaganda by saying it's ""racist"" to call it the ""Chinese Wuhan virus"" even though they, themselves, were using that same terminology just a week ago. I found this useful list of drug prevention and treatment options for COVID-19 One article from what can be considered biased sources should not convince any scientist that this article is gospel.  My background leads me to believe that there is more research conducted by private researchers that does not receive corporate support. I suspect that the rapid spread of COVID-19 is NOT an accidental mutation, but further independent research is needed. Just like Independent research exposed the true causes of autism before those scientists met with suspicious deaths, we will get to the bottom of the origin of COVID-19, hopefully in a shorter period of time. Does anyone have a critical analysis of the validity (or otherwise) of the information presented in this Sri Lanka TV site: If true, then it seems potentially very important, but I haven’t seen it reported in any other mainstream (e.g. UK gov) sites, and haven’t been able to corroborate it or debunk it. The Chinese are doing clinical trials with intravenous Vitamin C to prevent ARDS.  There is a treatment protocol called the Marik protocol that has been in use in ICU's in the US using Intravenous Vitamin C, thiamine and corticosteroids that has had impressive success in treating sepsis and ARDS when used early in the patient's course. One potentially helpful preventative measure is the consumption of baking soda (1/2 tsp. in 8 ounces of water) daily.  Here is a link to the article describing the modulating effect  of baking soda on the body's immune response: When COVID-19 patients deteriorate it is often because of a cytokine storm mounted by the body to try to defeat the novel virus to which there are no antibodies.  Preparing the body in advance by consuming baking soda could prevent this from happening.  It's a safe thing to do...kidney patients are often encouraged to do this to prevent the advancement of kidney disease. It's important for ongoing studies to confirm everything we assume about this virus, other viruses, and how they all interact, so it's not likely medical science will start recommending this in wide swaths of the population in the near future. There is some really helpful info on the . For most adults, studies show the vaccines are helpful at reducing infection in about 45% of recipients, which is good, but far from a sure thing. For older people, or those with other medical conditions, it's certainly something that looks promising. I'm looking forward to hearing more info on how this current pandemic will impact the way medical professionals view these very specific types of vaccines. Once things start to settle down again, I'll definitely at least talk to my doctor about this kind of preventative step, though I am fortunate enough to find myself ill only once every few years and it tends to pass within a day or two at most.

We're excited to hear from you! I rather miss taking simple proximity for granted - particularly in grocery store aisles. Now it's a full-on panic attack if someone is coming down the aisle from a different direction and taking up the center. I also miss the leisurely strolls through the shopping mall. The most casual window shopping and consumerism that would often serve as a good reason to get out of the house. The 6 foot distance is arbitrary . It does not take into consideration air currents, which can carry an infectious aerosol for two or three times that distance. Thus don't think one is safe once the 6 foot distance is maintained. Sure, six feet is safer than 4 feet, and 10 feet is safer than 6 feet, etc. The line from your living room to the nearest person outside your residence is probably the safest distance to maintain. Stay home unless absolutely necessary. I miss seeing all my friends at church and all the hugs.  I miss interacting with employees at stores like Lowes, Wal-Mart  small shops and neighbors.  We miss getting together with our kids and friends to play games and have dinner together. As retirees and not social much other than our families we don't mix much other than at the grocery store and pharmacy. But, I do miss talking with other genealogists and helping others with their family history at our local Family History Center, where I volunteer weekly. But, I can and do a lot of work on mine at home, such as the 500 page report I'm tidying up and adding to now. Meanwhile my wife brings us and our disabled son joy with her wonderful homemade bread, which she hadn't done in 20+ years. I still keep our outside birds well fed and our 3 inside cats happy. I keep in touch with our daughters and grandchildren over the phone, and will be trying out Skype soon. Touching things/people/surfaces. Touching is almost a reflex action for humans but now I'm leery about it, thanks to COVID-19. I'm instantly alert whenever someone gets within 3 feet of me. Feels like we're all  part of a bad Hollywood -style disaster movie and it's not gonna end anytime soon. I definitely miss going outside whenever I like. Before, if I wanted to take a walk, there was no reason I shouldn't, but now I hardly ever get to go outside because I then have to awkwardly move to the other side of the street whenever another person is there. I took for granted just doing  my own cooking -& doing the usual meals -but now 'm going to try some new ones -or doing one thats more difficult Hugs for friends and neighbors. We are all getting used to the elbow bump in our farming community, but the simple, warm, human act of hugging has been taken from us.  I look forward to this simple pleasure again! ~LC The ability to go to work!  Now more than ever I need work!  I live in Arkansas and my landlords may kick me out in the middle of this pandemic! Toilet paper--of course! LOL! Oh no! I hope by this time that Arkansas has adopted rules like those in California that restrict/forbid evictions during the Covid-19 crisis. I just miss going out and exploring. There has been a lot of new growth in my city with new restaurants and shops opening in the past few months and I always liked to pick one of them and stop in and see what's up, what they have to offer, etc. Now I can't really do that. This is going to sound silly, but I miss the icecream truck.  I used to be a homecare worker and seeing people end up in hospital constantly scared me into eating really healthy.  My supplements literally form a handful in my palm.  The ice-cream truck was such a temptation.  Whistling it’s tune though it’s speakers weaving in and out of the streets.  Sometimes i would go outside and realized  the song had tricked me because he was still mozying down another street.  I bet reading this the tune has started up in your head and now you want icecream.   it was the perfect sin.  It gave you the excuse, how can i refuse that when it’s literally right out side my door.  I used to get a banana float because if youre going to get sidetracked from eating healthy, you may as well get the biggest.  People always laughed watching me carry in that triple glacier with two long sides of banana Into the house. pretty much the only thing we're doing without is t library.  my partner transcribes from home and is working overtime. With the new ""Social Distancing"" regulations, things have become something of a mixed bag: 1: No more ""stopping for a burger to get out of the weather"" or having dinner at a nice restaurant.  No more ""movies on Saturday night"" and ""Pizza with the gang""; that sort of stuff. 2: No burger-stops equals my cholesterol levels are a bit lower, and nice restaurants are also expensive ones. No Saturday night movies means that there is no screeching, whining five-year-old behind you (and infanticide is so very illegal...) and no ""Pizza with the gang"" means no garlic-flavored hangover the next morning (usually a workday). So, all in all, like I said: it's a mixed bag.  We'll be better for accepting the change, methinks. The Internet has been a ""take-it-for-granted"" thing until recently.  Now it's a safe way to socialize.  There are even like that allow you to experience a form of normal social interaction with zero likelihood of being infected by anyone. Ah yes, the times they are a-changin'... Hugs & kisses from the UK to everyone (inc Admins) on here ok Am I the only Brit on here Basic freedoms.  We are becoming more and more a police state where freedoms are a thing of the past. Dun think so...  China is a police state, and their rate of infections was way lower than ours.  We're still free, and the rate of infections shows it.  A Police State would have had far fewer infections than we do since the populace would be but that happening What is happening here is an attempt to slow the rate of infections by restricting known methods of transfer. That's not like a police state, that's just concern and attempted protection. This reminds me of the old saying, ""You never miss the water till the well runs dry"".  Historically, from Egypt forward, in times of stress it's the small things that are most missed.  I guess that still applies today. I live in a senior community where our hugs (and sometimes kisses) upon greeting one another often are the only human contact we get in a day. I don't want to be man-handled, but just a little touch from time to time can make the difference between feeling like a valued member of society and feeling like an outcast. And with our masks in place, we sometimes have trouble even recognizing one another! Very sad. Being able to go into a coffee shop, and do computer stuff.  So simple, and now impossible.  I miss it very much."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/b-1-618.5648/,B.1.618,"I happened upon the B.1.618 Covid variant on Wednesday in unreliable Asian media outlets and and have continued to try and find any 'reliable' source covering this. At the moment I am only finding it covered in Indian media outlets and the occasional reference in sensationalism. It is not identified on the CDC site (although with the number of mutations I am not surprised until there is some validity). Can anyone share some light on this variant? The issue with a lot of the population of India is that they believe that a deity will determine whether they die or not and not the virus which is why we see tens or hundreds of thousands gathering along the Ganges river with no masks or social distancing In Leicester UK we have many who have come from there and is probably why we have been in lockdown for over 12 months WHO etc are looking into whether the new variant in India can get by the current vaccines Thank you for a very unscientific response that has no connection to the question I pose. I believe you are referring to the triple variant version of the virus for which plasma therapy is ineffective.  This triple variant is endemic in four Indian states and so far has statistically greater morbidity.  Mortality is as of yet undetermined.  Basically, that's what information is available via a perfunctory Web search.  There is currently research in-progress to determine current vaccine(s) efficaciousness for the B.1.618 variant.  Please post any findings for I suspect that this variant will go global. Thank you for your reply, you have basically re-written my comment and tried to pass it off as your own. Seems this forum is about as scientific as what I used to have on yah00!, shame. Please note:  My comment is about what specifically I  thought you were posting, and the data I could find.  I did not intend to rewrite.  Just trying to help because I am very concerned about the triple variant as well as the double variant generating a third wave outbreak in the U.S.   I.E.:  A marked number of people here have declined the  available vaccines out of sheer distrust of the available information, both statistical and generic, about the vaccines and the disease.   However. many in the U.S. are aghast at the terrible ordeal that India is now experiencing.  Perhaps additional data will be a ""spur"" to get more reluctant folks to accept the vaccines.  So, please do post any concrete data  about this new serious risk to world health. I would, but that is my request in my original post 'Can anyone share some light on this variant? '. As it stands, it appears to be the 3rdmost common variant in India but no coverage has been raised outside sources I would deem unreliable... Weird that the gutter press havent made a headline form it."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/pub-closure.4297/,Pub Closure,"Originally Pubs had to deal with the loss of profit due to the decision that the Pubs must close at 10 pm. Many MPs asked to see the scientific evidence to support this decision but to no avail. The only loose explanation that I heard was to the effect that at the end of the evening alcohol would be taking over and social distancing would then become compromised Now the decision has been altered to last orders at 10 pm but the pub can stay open to 11pm. This seems to be completely in the face of the previous decision. It now puts a further burden on the publican that he must pay his staff for a further hour for no extra profit. Almost certainly a few drinkers will preorder several drinks at 10pm which destroys the first argument. This extra profit from pre ordered drinks probably will not cover the extra hour overhead As for the substantial meals argument, research in New York has found that the biggest breeding ground for Covid in New York  is in fact Restaurants. As the greater majority of infections are getting into households via school kids, then why not close them down to massively reduce infections and deaths? They did. Too late again ! The govt in the UK still do not seem to get it Schools currently stop the infection rate from falling but at least now with the vaccinations when they open the rates do not rise Infection rate graphs clearly shoe infection rates falling during school holidays and then levelling off when they return - this has happened twice very recently You will need to direct me to this or provide a graph and source. The three month trend for total cases is downwards so your comment 'Schools currently stop the infection rate from falling ' looks very wrong. Going three months back takes you to January when schools were all returning after Christmas. Look at the current slanted drops on the graph as they are when schools were on holls then look at what happens when they return - the graph clearly shows what happens What dates are you referring to as they are not identifiable on the graphs. UK school holls were February 12 to 22 and  March 27 to April 12 On the graph those dates are where the graph has the definable slants then following those the line is virtually level again but stays at the lower level they were brought down to by the closures Next week of school holls is May 29 to June 7 so I expect the same to happen again The start of the Summer holls is mid July until the start of September and if this trend continues then the infection rates should drop to almost zero and stay there especially as by that time virtually all UK adults will be vaccinated perhaps this interactive graph might be more useful I investigated the number of tests in the period and note there are less tests conducted in the school holiday period - This would be fully justifiable in that there would be less people to conduct tests and less ease to seek a test. Upon catching up the following week there are a rush of tests completed, but the % of positive is consistent over the dates provided. Do you agree this graph shows the biggest rise in cases around 28 December - 07 January?"

This was based both on animals trials and previous research on GS-441524. In some animals trials GS-441524 was compared directly with Remdesivir, as an anti coronavirus treatment, with GS-441524 becoming the preferred treatment. Gilead developed Remdesivir with the FDA, however it is much more complicated and expensive to make than GS-441524 and could be less effective but for numerous reasons Gilead will make more money from Remdesivir and the FDA may also has a financial interest in remdesivir. Critics say a long known promising Covid-19 treatment GS-441524 has not been studied and that it was delibrately blocked, for profit reasons, from Covid-19 researchers, having proper access to all the information on it. Prior lab studies have shown that GS-441524 is effective against coronaviruses SARS, MERS and FIP a near 100% fatal cat coronavirus that GS-441524 had a near 100% cure rate for. Gileads' responses have not addressed the points raised nor whether Gilead is promoting remdesivir because of its longer patent or why Gilead blocked and/or also had not encouraged or helped anyone researching the medical effectiveness of GS-441524 to resolve matters. Gilead has for a some years also refused to explain why it has not allowed the manufacture or licensing of GS-441524 for use in cats after successful animal trials cured cats of a fatal coronavirus disease A journalist writing in The Atlantic said ""After Ebola trials in previous years found little benefit, remdesivir became a drug in search of a (human) disease."" Some years ago GS-441524 and Remdesivir were both tested against FIP a 95% fatal cat coronavirus. Gilead was involved in these University of California animal tests providing the 25+ different drugs initially screened for use in the trials and credited in the published research. The trials showed both remdesivir and GS-441524 were effective against FIP however  GS-441524 was preferred and cured 100% of the coronavirus infected cats in the university tests.  Later field tests on pet cats confirmed GS-441524s effectiveness Strangely Gilead has refused to allow anyone to make or legally use GS-441524 on cats (or any animals or humans) despite repeated requests related to cats Thus long before Covid-19 cat owners were forced to buy GS-441524 on the black market to treat their cats and Gilead did nothing nor provided any explaination Critics say Gilead blocks GS-441524 as it is easier and cheaper to make and so will compete against Remdesivir meaning Gilead will make less money Following Gileads and the FDAs focus on remdesivir and their failure to enter into meaningful discussions or research on GS-441524, an open letter was written to the FDA and Gilead by a citizens advocacy group asking why GS-441524 was not being studied as a Covid-19 treatment and that the FDA and others be encouraged to do research or to explain why it was not scientifically and medically possible to do so. The citizens group writing the letter has formally raised medical and other matters over many years, is non political and has been critical of both the Trump administration and the FDA and their response to covid-19 and other citizens rights matters. For example they separately launched legal action against the FDA over what is said to be an unsafe medical device that the FDA  failed to withdraw. The FDA has just responded to the GS-441524 coronavirus research letter saying that they have now “reviewed the literature and agree that this compound merits further exploration,” The questions the seem important are why has it taken so long to start this work, why did it take a citizens group not doctors or researchers or health officials to get this to happen and will others also now be encouraged to also do research or will it remain a limited work within the FDA will Gilead do all it can to help serious researchers resolve if GS-441524 is more effective than remdesivir does the FDA have a financial interest in remdesivir which is why it favors that drug Gilead has yet to indicate that it will allow others outside the FDA to view any data it or the FDA holds or encourage third party research. Research indicates that GS-441524 is less toxic than remdesivir so can be given in higher doses and is much easier to make than remdesivir plus has many other benefits over remdesivir. Texas University researchers have responded to questions about why GC-441524 is probably superior - see statnews article already linked from May 2020 and the following q&a posted A private Dr highlighted GS-441524 in Feb 2020 in a Tampa Fl news article. According to journalists and others Gilead has not responded to requests to clarify its position on allowing GS-441524 for the treatment for cats and seems unwilling to provide any meaningful response to requests for clarification on a range of matters about GS-441524 including encouraging meaningful covid-19 research. Gileads responses have focused on stressing remdesivir benefits or passing comments about any researching of GS-441524 Gilead and the FDA jointly developed the drug Remdesivir however Gilead registered the patent without including any FDA rights though later published research papers clearly list the many government scientists involved GS-441524 was also developed and patented with other parties and is a very similar drug to remdesivir. The Gilead patent life for Remdesivir is 7+ years longer than the GS-441524 patent and for other reasons the GS-441524 patent may be less profitable for Gilead. Gilead has prior history of trying to exclude the FDA from participating in patent royalities the FDA contributed to developing. In a letter to leadership of Gilead Sciences, Inc., the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Public Citizen and two scientists specializing in cancer drug development offer a detailed summary of scientific evidence suggesting that the experimental antiviral drug GS-441524 may be a better drug than the closely-related drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19. The letter asks Gilead and the federal agencies either to work collaboratively to promptly pursue the development of GS-441524 as a treatment for COVID-19 or to publicly explain and provide evidence as to why doing so is not scientifically or medically feasible. The links to the open letter to Gilead and the FDA and other articles and info are below Open letter to Gilead and FDA FDA response “reviewed the literature and agree that this compound merits further exploration,” Michael Abrams Phd , health researcher at Public Citizen and lead author of the letter to the FDA states “Such further study of the drug is long overdue, especially given the evidence that GS-441524 may be cheaper and easier to manufacture and more amenable to administration in inhaled or oral forms than remdesivir.” “We hope that Gilead will respond similarly and commit to working collaboratively with the NIH to study the potential of GS-441524, even if it means the company may reap lower profits than expected from the marketing of remdesivir,” Abrams added. Research on GS-441524 Lab tests have suggested GS-441524 is active against SARS-CoV-2, and it is apparently similar or superior to the effects of remdesivir at levels that do not cause much toxicity, according to the Anderson researchers, who want to run their own tests. They also maintain the compound is more easily synthesized than remdesivir, so it should be easier to create oral versions and make higher doses. The nucleoside analog GS-441524 strongly inhibits feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies 10 cats were infected with FIP and then treated with GS-441524. All 10 cats recovered. Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA, USA Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA Accepted 14 April 2018 Current knowledge about the antivirals remdesivir (GS-5734) and GS-441524 as therapeutic options for coronaviruses Susan Amirian Julie K.Levy Public Health & Healthcare Program, Texas Policy Lab, School of Social Sciences, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA Accepted 24 March 2020, The Atlantic The background to the long term Cat research GS-441524 and the treatment people are using to cure cats of a deadly coronavirus that kills around 95% of infected cats Around 5 years ago Gilead sent University researchers 25 or 30 molecules, drawn from the large library of drug candidates that pharmaceutical companies typically maintain. Two of the molecules worked marvelously in cat cells infected with the FIP virus: GS-441524 and GS-5734, the latter of which is now better known as remdesivir. After Ebola trials found little benefit, remdesivir became a drug in search of a (human) disease. Both molecules were effective, so Pedersen decided to pursue the simpler one, GS-441524. He then infected 10 cats with FIP and dosed them with GS-441524. All 10 cats recovered. “We almost fell out of our chairs,” says Weigner. in a follow-up field trial of 31 pets with naturally acquired FIP, 25 ultimately made it—an unheard-of recovery rate. Despite the success, Gilead refused to license GS-441524 for use in cats. While Pedersen was testing GS-441524 in cats, a different virus—a human virus—was raging halfway around the world in West Africa: Ebola. The virus that causes Ebola is not a coronavirus, but remdesivir is unusually broad-acting for an antiviral, and early results against Ebola were promising. So promising, in fact, that the company was eyeing FDA approval of remdesivir in humans. According to Pedersen, Gilead worried that the cat research could impede the approval process for remdesivir. Because GS-441524 and remdesivir are so similar, any adverse effects uncovered in cats might have to be reported and investigated to guarantee remdesivir’s safety in humans. Gilead’s caution about generating unnecessary cat data is standard industry practice. “One of the rules in drug development is never perform a test you don’t have to, if the results could be problematic,” says Richard Sachleben, a retired pharma-industry researcher. (Gilead declined to comment for this story.) Pharmalot The U.S. government contributed research to a Gilead remdesivir patent — but didn’t get credit By Ed Silverman @Pharmalot May 8, 2020 September 2015 in which Gilead sought a U.S. patent for a using the compound for any number of coronavirus infections. Although the code Gilead assigned to the compound – GS-5734 – does not appear in the body of the application, experts who have reviewed the chemical structure say the compound is remdesivir. One month later, some of the same Gilead employees whose names appeared on the patent application were listed as co-authors on a Nature research paper – along with numerous government scientists – showing remdesivir, specifically, held promise in fighting Ebola and other coronaviruses. The paper also noted testing was conducted at high-risk security labs run by the federal government. The role played by the federal government in developing remdesivir to combat coronaviruses has, in fact, involved various grants to universities, as well as contributions from government personnel at such agencies as the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, according to Knowledge Ecology International, an advocacy group that first disclosed these connections. But while it remains unclear the extent to which federal funds contributed to the R&D, the patent is of particular interest because it is tangible evidence that government work yielded something of potential financial value to the company. Yet government employees are not listed as inventors, which one expert suggested should be corrected, especially in an era when federally financed research might be leveraged to collect royalties or, arguably, lower the price of medicines. “In this case, all of these scientists were really working together very intimately on research that led to the molecule,” said Arti Rai, a Duke University law professor who specializes in intellectual property and a former U.S. Patent and Trademark Office official, who is researching remdesivir patents and the role played by the federal government. “Gilead actually had a huge number of patents on the molecules, but had to do a tremendous amount of work to figure out which variations of the various molecules would work against the biological models the government had. This patent illustrates the essence of why collaboration between the public and private sectors is important, not just in terms of money, such as grants, but resources.” “What really matters is how much money the government has put into research, but if their names were on there, it would help to make the case there was a lot of in-kind contribution from the government,” she explained. “Right now, if Gilead tried to assert rights (in response to a patent challenge), there would be no way to know there was some government right to a license to the patent.” Generally, one must play connect the dots to find government assistance. For instance, the National Institutes of Health gave grants to several universities whose researchers worked with Gilead scientists. Their efforts appeared in a 2018 paper in the American Society for Microbiology, which found remdesivir can combat coronaviruses, noted Tahir Amin, who heads the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge, an advocacy group that challenged various Gilead patents on hepatitis C medicines. We asked Gilead, which several months ago sought to add claims to the patent, for comment and will update you accordingly. Numerous consumer advocates, academics, and lawmakers have argued that prescription drugs invented with taxpayer dollars should be affordable to Americans. Public Citizen estimated that U.S. taxpayers contributed $70.5 million to remdesivir R&D overall. “Since we’re paying for the research, we shouldn’t expect to be at disadvantage,” said Jamie Love of Knowledge Ecology International. “The argument that you have to have a high price because a company made big investments is harder to justify when there was a large public financing role in the R&D. A high company may say a high price is necessary, but the rationale falls apart when we’re paying for the R&D.” Gilead has often been at the center of such debates. As noted previously, the drug maker and the federal government filed dueling lawsuits over patents that formed the basis of a best-selling HIV prevention pill called Truvada. The government claims Gilead should pay royalties on its patents, which stemmed, in part, from taxpayer funding, while the company has argued the government patents are invalid. Feb 2020 news article on GS-441524 By Dr. Joette Giovinco Dr. Joette Giovinco wrote a press article highlighting GS-441524 in Feb 2020 as a promising Covid-19 treatment Remdesivir is a promising antiviral drug and works by inhibiting the activity of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). GS-441524 is a feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) inhibitor and a predominant metabolite of Remdesivir that is superior to Remdesivir against COVID-19. First GS-441524 shows comparable efficacy in cell-based models of primary human lung and cat cells infected with the coronavirus. GS-441524 could strongly inhibit feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), with an EC50of 0.78 μM. Recent research in coronavirus-infected nonhuman primates demonstrated problems with remdesivir that inadvertently showed the antiviral effectiveness of GS-441524. In multiple studies testing remdesivir in coronavirus-infected mice or rhesus macaques, it was rapidly converted to GS-441524 in the bloodstream..... injection of remdesivir in NHP results in GS-441524 being present in serum at concentrations 1000-fold higher than remdesivir throughout a 7-day treatment course (Figure 3b). Last but not the least, GS-441524 is capable of treating cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) with a 96% cure rate. Importantly, coupled with the robust antiviral activity of GS-441524 against FIP, these data compel further investigations into the therapeutic and prophylactic utility of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2. All in all, GS-441524, a FIPV inhibitor, is a predominant metabolite of Remdesivir and superior to Remdesivir against COVID-19. GILEAD owns patent rights to GS-441524 (2009) and Remdesivir (2017); The 2009 patent of GS-441524 may be invalid due to prior art: as we have seen in the GILEAD vs MERK trial (which Merk initially won), there is a large amount of prior art in the nucleoside space that may invalidate the GS-441524 patent. Covid-19 treatnent research drug GC376 A final thought - great research is being done on Covid-19 some of it is below on another drug also tested on cats with FIP. However this drug GC376 was much less successful than GS-441524 The researchers of GC376 are clearly very good and professional However how is it Covid-19 treatment research can be done on GC376 with cat coronavirus FIP treatment effectiveness being cited as one of the reasons for rapid research, and yet this not happen on GS-441524 when its almost 100% effective against the cat coronavirus FIP and worked well against other coronaviruses plus GS-441524 is potentially better than remdesivir ? antiviral GC376 out of Kansas State University had previously been tested but only seven out of 20 cats had gone into remission. Those results seemed impressive at the time, but GS-441524 appeared to be even better ""Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1-7 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s). Severe neurologic disease occurred in 8/13 cats that failed treatment and five cats had recurrences of abdominal lesions. At the time of writing, seven cats were in disease remission."" Research on GC376 Published: 27 August 2020 Feline coronavirus drug GC376 inhibits the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and blocks virus replication GC376 has been used to successfully treat FIP in cats as its breakdown product, GC373, effectively inhibits the Mpro of FCoV. Analogs of these drugs also inhibited the MERS CoV Mpro and blocked viral replication in cells at an EC50 of 0.5 μM14. Our studies show GC376 and GC373 to be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, in agreement with previous studies showing GC373 and GC376 possess broad specificity against the Mpro of coronaviruses and calciviruses (Supplementary Table 2)10,13,14,22. Clearly, these drugs need to be advanced quickly into human trials for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and is a virus with a significant mutation rate23. Also, in some patients the virus has persisted longer than 2 months with some possibility of re-infection24. Vaccines are critically important, but still likely a year or more away as this virus may present vaccine challenges. There are many clinical trials testing drugs re-purposed from their original indications. Remdesivir, a polymerase inhibitor developed as a treatment for Ebola virus25 had initially been used in compassion cases, and is now FDA approved for emergency use in patients with COVID-19...... How was a long known treatment found and blocked for a new condition? Critics say Gilead has blocked the use of or studies on its drug GS-441524 on Covid-19 because Gilead will make less money despite evidence that GS-441524 will be as or more effective than Gileads other drug remdesivir Both remdesivir (GS-5734) and GS-441524 are owned in full or part by Gilead and are almost identical chemically. GS-441524 is much simpler to make than remdesivir so much cheaper to produce and has extensively used on cats to cure about 96% of cats with a fatal cat coronavirus - FIP GS-441524 is the ""predominant metabolite of Remdesivir"" GS-441524 was successful in prior lab studies against coronaviruses SARS, MERS and FIP a near 100% fatal cat coronavirus that GS-441524 cures Some years ago Gilead and the University of California did tests with GS-441524 on cats with FIP both in lab settings and later on pet cats with the 100% fatal cat coronavirus FIP - GS-441524 was an almost 100% successful cure Gilead refused to allow GS-441524 to be manufactured to treat cats, so it has for many years been made without permission and used by cat owners and cat charities to successfully and rapidly treat cats who are in critical and fatal condition The patent life for GS-441524 is much shorter than remdesivir and could be challanged or need to be shared and so Gilead will make less money. Gilead has a history of seeking to exclude the FDA for sharing patents it has a right to due to the FDA facilities, researchers and indirect financial support - with the need for patent litigation between the FDA and Gilead being publically discussed over previous drugs Gilead failed to included the FDA in its remdesivir patent filings despite published research and papers crediting FDA researchers and facilities for much of the work and development As early as Feb 2020 Drs were pointing out GS-441524 could be a very effective covid-19 treatment Further research shows GS-441524 is the effective compound in remdesivir High Potency Remdesivir studies show GS-441524 is the effective compound that is left in lungs to treat covid-19 Robert O. Williams III, study co-author said “And importantly, new data from the study regarding the formulation of remdesivir with leucine suggest that the TFF formulation can significantly prolong the duration of the remdesivir nucleoside analog GS-441524 in the lung, providing a important therapeutic benefit for lung delivery.” High Potency Remdesivir and normal remdesivir are effectively just producing another cheaper Gilead drug GS-441524 Studies have shown GS-441524 is the effective compound that remdesivir (GS-5734) is converted into and GS-441524 is left in lungs to treat Covid-19 infection. So why not use GS-441524 rather than remdesivir. Robert O. Williams III, study co-author said “And importantly, new data from the study regarding the formulation of remdesivir with leucine suggest that the TFF formulation can significantly prolong the duration of the remdesivir nucleoside analog GS-441524 in the lung, providing a important therapeutic benefit for lung delivery.” There has been no real news about what research the FDA has started doing on GS-441524 despite the FDA belatedly admitting in August they had now “reviewed the literature and agree that this compound (GS-441524) merits further exploration,” Gilead has refused to research GS-441524 which has a shorter patent than remdedivir, despite it being almost identical to remdesivir and the main metabolite of remdesivir. The treatment study about high potency remdesivir is different to the work on GS-441524 but supports the questions raised It looks like different researchers at the University of Texas are working on remdesivir and GS-441524. It is unclear if this will cause a conflict of interest or not or if any co-ordination is taking place Further research indicates a highly effective fatal cat coronavirus treatment drug GS-441524 (also owned by Gilead) is a direct competitor, more effective and a cheaper treatment against Covid-19 than Gilead's remdesivir (GS-5734) treatment For full links to published studies, news and the FDA response agreeing Covid-19 treatment research should be done on GS-441524 see link at start of this response or the start of this thread. The FDA responded in August to an open letter to Gilead and the FDA  from a well respected citizens rights group and University of Texas researchers asking why GS-441524 was not being researched as a Covid-19 treatment despite extensive long established research studies and animal treatment showing its high effectiveness against various coronaviruses and being simpler and almost identictical to remdesivir This includes widespread use of GS-441524 over some years with a near 100% success rate as a treatment for a common and fatal cat coronavirus, and successful previous use against other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS Gilead failed to respond to the letter or the Texas researchers or materially address their position on GS-441524 Neither the FDA or Gilead have explained why no research on GS-441524 was carried out or even considered to date or promoted despite researchers and others setting out their findings or serious questions / comments since around Feb 2020 and certainly by May 2020 With the FDA now confirming that the long standing research on GS-441524 going back many years had merit and would now be looked into questions should be asked about the FDAs duties and why Gilead has acted against the public interest in blocking research on GS-441524 over many years and did Gilead have the right to do so ? Also has Gilead claimed rights over a patent for GS-441524 that it had only questionable rights to ? Advantages of the Parent Nucleoside GS-441524 over Remdesivir for Covid-19 Treatment Victoria C. Yan* and Florian L. Muller University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77054, United States Cite this: ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2020, 11, 7, 1361–1366 Publication Date:June 23, 2020 Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society In Feb 2020 Professor Pedersen from the University of California was interviewed about Covid-19 pointing out that he had discovered and conducted clinical trials on a very successful cure for a fatal cat coronavirus and that this work was being ignored by public health officials and others. This drug is Gilead's GS-441524 which Gilead has refused over many years to allow any licensing, research, production or official use in animals let alone humans. Dr. Niels Pedersen has spent 50 years studying the coronavirus, specifically a strain found in cats, called Feline Infectious Peritonitis or FIP, for short. Some other Drs and researchers also highlighted GS-441524 as a potentially important Covid-19 cure but were ignored. However GS-441524 has been unofficially used over many years to treat cats with the 100% fatal coronavirus FIP and has about a 96% successful cure rate GS-441524 is almost identical to Gilead's preferred Covid-19 drug Remdesivir (GS-5734) GS-441524 was also effective against the coronaviruses SARS and MERS Further researchers have set out based on historic and current research testing and animal use that GS-441524 is probably safer less toxic and more effective against Covid-19 than Remdesivir plus also cheaper and simpler to make and can probably be taken orally unlike Remdesivir It should be noted that Remdesivir actually converts into GS-441524 in the human body to be effective against Covid-19 and GS-441524 becomes the main metabolite of Remdesivir - so a big question is why give Remdesivir and not GS-441524? At the very least GS-441524 should have been extensively researched as a Covid-19 treatment. Requests to Gilead for info on GS-441524 or assistance with research were extensively stonewalled until a recent open letter to the FDA and Gilead made public what was going on. The FDA subsquently admitted in writing that GS-441524 should be researched as a Covid-19 treatment Advantages of the Parent Nucleoside GS-441524 over Remdesivir for Covid-19 Treatment Victoria C. Yan* and Florian L. Muller Cite this: ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2020, 11, 7, 1361–1366 Publication Date:June 23, 2020 Further info is in my previous posts The following info comes mostly from a web site that focuses on cats with FIP the fatal cat coronavirus. Links below University of California was actively involved in developing GS-441524 as a treatment for the fatal cat coronavirus FIP and later researchers pointed out it could be equally effective against Covid-19 which Gilead did not investigate. It looks like Gilead may have decided to move forward with using GS-441524 as a treatment for the fatal Cat coronavirus FIP at the same time that Remdesivir was removed from the list of approved ebola treatments - around August 2019 However once Covid-19 emerged in Jan 2020 Gilead turned its attention back to Remdesivir and dropped GS-441524 For economic reasons ? Gilead would prefer its Remdesivir patent to be used as a Covid-19 treatment and not GS-441524 which is jointly owned and may also be subject to other patent challanges. See previous posts At some earlier point it seems that Gilead had filed the patent for GS-441524 in only its name but then in August 2019 amended the application to add the University of California. I cannot find much separate supporting info however it seems that the patent for GS-441524 is now jointly owned by Gilead and the University of California plus this filing was made at about the same time in August 2019 that Remdesivir was removed from the list of NIH approved ebola drugs. This might explain Gileads reluctance to promote or research GS-441524 as a treatment for humans or animals until it thought Remdesivir had little future. It could also explain Gileads back tracking on GS-441524 for cats or humans once Covid-19 came along to save Remdesivir in Jan 2020 Gileads actions on Remdesivir Vs GS-441524  as a Covid-19 or FIP treatment have certainly not been transparent or helpful. I could be shooting at clouds but as I found this info I thought it was better in the public domain to let others dig deeper to seeif anything is ""there there"" See links and info below Gilead mulls repositioning failed Ebola drug in China virus - Jan 2020 The patent rights to GS-441524 are Gilead Sciences, Inc, and the Regents of the University of California (a patent applicant change was made on the 08/12/2019 to add the Regents of the University of California) The following is a footnote at the bottom of the related page link On August 12, 2019 Anthony Fauci, Director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases announced that Remdesivir had been removed from the current Ebola clinical trials, citing a mortality rate of 53%. Gilead has filed the Remdesivir patent in its sole name but the FDA probably has a good claim to jointly own the patent. Remdesivir, an experimental COVID-19 treatment, has benefited significantly from public funding. Based off publicly available data, Public Citizen estimates that taxpayers are contributing at least $70.5 million to develop remdesivir.[1] The real number is likely higher. We trace the story below. Darmok and Gilead...... A recent public posting on 17th September 2020 by a legal firm (Kershaw, Cook & Talley) on its web site about ongoing litigation confirms that Gilead has a history of withholding more effective less harmful drugs it owns, developed at the same time, for commercial reasons - and only releasing the better drug 15 years later as a ""new"" improved treatment once the more toxic and damaging drug was nearing the end of its patent life Kershaw, Cook & Talley - statements and comments Gilead Sciences, Inc. and the federal government have been accused of withholding [GS-441524] a promising treatment for COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, that may offer “significant advantages” over Remdesivir, currently Gilead’s sole drug undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment, according to Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy organization. Kershaw, Cook & Talley is actively pursuing a lawsuit alleging that Gilead engaged in nearly identical conduct regarding the marketing of TDF- and TAF-based drugs used in the treatment and prevention of HIV infection over 20 years earlier. The allegations Public Citizen brought forward concerning Gilead’s conduct with respect to Remdesivir and GS-441524 is remarkably similar to its alleged conduct in a lawsuit pending in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of thousands of individuals represented by Kershaw, Cook & Talley and other law firms across the United States. In this lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that Gilead developed TDF-based drugs — commonly known as Viread®, Truvada®, Truvada for PrEP®, Atripla®, Complera® and Stribild® — for the treatment and prevention of HIV infection, while it simultaneously developed TAF-based drugs proved to be safer and at least equally effective at much smaller doses. Gilead’s own studies demonstrated that TDF had a much higher risk of severe side effects, including bone loss and kidney failure. Gilead chose to sell TDF and kept TAF (the safer drug) off the market for nearly 15 years. Plaintiffs allege that this strategy was enacted solely to maximize Gilead’s profits and extend its patent protection for these life-saving drugs. Once the patent on TDF ran out, Gilead then came out with TAF and marketed it as a “new and improved” drug with fewer side effects than TDF. To date, almost 18,000 plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against Gilead, which have been consolidated in San Francisco Superior Court for pretrial discovery. In an August 4 letter, Public Citizen and scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Center alleged that both Gilead and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have been sitting on a drug known as GS-441524 despite the fact that it has shown superior antiviral behavior against the coronavirus in cell cultures compared to Remdesivir. Gilead is accused of keeping GS-441524 on the shelf in order to extend its monopoly over drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19. “It is sadly predictable that Big Pharma responds to a global pandemic by trying to bring to market only those drugs that maximize its profits,” said Michael Abrams, health researcher with Public Citizen’s Health Research Group and lead author of the letter. “What is alarming here is that federal scientists and Trump administration regulators appear to be willing partners with Gilead in decisions that run distinctly counter to the government’s primary imperative of advancing public health during this worldwide crisis.” Kershaw, Cook & Talley Gilead is in a patent dispute with the FDA over patents the FDA was almost certainly entitled to and directly or indirectly funded and/or researched - this patent dispute is related to the same drug Truvada that Gilead is accused of  bringing to market even though it had also developed a less toxic and more and/or as effective alternative which Gilead released only many years later Financial Times report that the company didn’t seek patent protection for the drug to cover PrEP use in the U.S. As a result, the drugmaker could owe $1 billion or more in royalties and damages to the government, according to the newspaper. Gilead disagreed with that conclusion and argued its Truvada patents cover all uses for the drug, the FT reported. And no one knows about it. Instead of jerking your wad with it here, go to the major news outlets. I agree with you - too much wad I did send a message to a journalist late this week That was after I found  the recent litigation background statement about Gilead, with the specific references to Gilead and GS-441524, plus the 2019 confirmation from Gilead it was blocking research on GS-441524 to support Remdesivir. I guess I write too much for people to read and its not always very clear If you know any journalists send them the links to these posts I have learned about whats happened slowly over time. This has been a way to record the info publically. The info is hidden all over the place Something does not add up - why block research into a hugely successful coronavirus drug during this crisis in favor of a similar drug that has only limited benefit. Lets summarize for anyone who hasnt read the extensive previous posts/wad I only post things if there are credible web links to the info - I have backed it up on the public online wayback archieve incase it should disappear from the web GS-441524 and Remdesivir are almost chemically identical and produce the same anti coronavirus metabolite A range of independent university researchers set out GS-441524 looks much more effective against covid-19 than Remdesivir - they show how it is much less toxic, delivers much more of the same anti coronavirus metabolite than Remdesivir ever could, is much cheaper to make and much easier to give to patient etc etc. GS-441524 was 100% effective in clinical lab animal trials against a 100% fatal cat coroavirus. 96% effective when given to pet animals with the infection. Gileads GS-441524 patent is less profitable than its Remdesivir patent - as its jointly owned and has a shorter life. There is nothing stopping Gilead testing both drugs side by side - they produce the same active anti coronavirus metabolite Gilead is facing litigation claims from 18,000 people that it held back a less toxic better drug until the patent expired on a worse drug that damaged and may have killed people. Gilead had the research for both drugs all the time but it is claimed wanted to make money on both drugs so held back the better drug to release 15 years later as a new improved version.  Gilead already faces patent breach claims from the FDA for both the two litigation related drugs and will also over remdesivir if the FDA acts as it should. Gilead has settled some other serious charges Gilead officially said in 2019 long before coronavirus that it would not allow research development or sales of GS-441524 for humans or animals until Remdesivir was approved by the FDA This despite having 100% clinical evidence GS-441524 was a cure for a 100% fatal coronavirus illness but no similar clinical evidence to  support remdesivir Note Remdesivir had pretty much failed to treat anything and in 2019 it is set out that it was removed from medical use by the FDA. After coronavirus Gilead continued to stonewall third party research requests and did not do any GS-441524 research itself etc There are enough serious people now admitting something is wrong in not researching GS-441524 - even the FDA cannot hide any more after an open letter was sent in August and the FDA agreed to urgently do research in late August. Gilead has not been clear about the priority it will give such research Did some good guys in the FDA  know all along that research should be done on GS-441524 ? Things do not add up but the mainstream press is ignoring it, and even the specialist press only writes on a limited specific points No one is asking why did the FDA and Gilead not research GS-441524 and what communication was there before the open letter to the FDA and Gilead forced them to say it should have been and now will be researched ? Others fast tracked university Covid-19 lab research into a drug similar to GS-441524 that being GC376 - both tested at UC Davis [GC376 was only about 1/3 as effective as GS-441524  ] University Professors now report the GC376 drug has been positioned for fast human clinical trials in  Canada and FDA approval in the USA all because its patent owners allowed 2020 lab research to go forward and previous clinical trial research shows GC376 acted against a fatal cat coronavirus virus - GC376 was never FDA approved for animal use UC Davis studies of both drugs show GS-441524 was light years better and was pretty much a 100% coronavirus cure in live animals compared to about 35% for GC376 I have nothing against GC376, the research looks great and well done. However it makes not researching GS-441524 even less understandable All this is public info Given whats going on with covid-19 and the status Remdesivir was given by the FDA some answers are due on GS-441524. I guess the mainstream press are staying away from asking these questions and upsetting big pharma in favor of getting some of the $30 billion pharma spent in 2019 on marketing and advertizing. Big pharma/healthcare are also the far biggest spenders on lobbying and donating to politicians. I hoped people here might be interested and look into this themselves - as the process of finding treatments will effect all of us I found a livescience staff writer article about Remdesivir and GS-441524 and posted on that page as well - which Valentine commented on Hope other people can take this forward. When making claims about a topic, please cite sources. While you have many links to a variety of topics, I mean claims made, such as: ""Critics say Gilead has blocked the use"" What specific critics? Where have they said this? What specific wording did they use? By allowing folks to see who has the concerns, the specific nature of their concern, and what alternatives they believe to be best, you allow folks to make truly informed decisions. It's just important for discussions like this that we avoid blanket statements that imply assumptions that may not be correct. For example, if I see this comment, I'm going to want a source that I can read up on so I can get the full context: ""Experts concluded ground beef is the perfect pizza topping."" People who love ground beef on pizza won't even question this. Literally everyone else is going to want to read the source of that conclusion. Sorry I did not make clear that all the links to all the various claims are in the previous posts above starting from 28th and 30th August onward Please note I only make serious comments that can be backed up by serious third party links. I mentioned this on other posts Just to reclarify the links I use are from mainstream sources medical news websites, legal firm web site postings, government web sites, well reputed citizens rights groups etc [not conspiracy sites] I have set out a few of the previous links I posted a little later below to fully answer your questions However to show how questionable the situation is regarding GS-441524 research please read the info and links I have set out later below, and in other posts, about how another drug GC-376 (owned by another company) has been fast tracked for human trials in about 2 month (from at least March 2020) and is now already ""ready"", for phase 1 clinical trials  while GS-441524 which was previously tested against GC-376 has been ignored. It seems Gileads is favoring its other drug remdesivier while an independent party has acted differently Why is the GC-376 vs GS-441524 comparison valid ? Because GC-376 and GS-441524 were tested against each other at University of California trials over some years, and GS-441524 proved to have an almost 100% cure rate against a fatal cat coronavirus while GC-376 had only about 35% cure rate. Not only that but researchers also looked at using remdesivir in the animal trials and decided in favor of GS-441524,  however after the great results Gilead refused to allow GS-441524 to be developed - (all this is documented and confirmed without meaningful explanation by Gilead) Additionally not only has GS-441524 been researched for many years from around 2009, and has proved effective in lab tests against the SARS and MERS coronavirus, but it is the main effective anti Covid-19 metabolite of Gileads Remdesivir In general terms researchers have set out that GS-441524 is much less toxic than Remdesivir (papers linked below and previous posts etc). To be clear Remdesivir is expelled from the body and GS-441524 is what remains to fight Covid-19. For the body to convert remdesivir to GS-441524 makes little obvious sense when one can take GS-441524 directly (and not stress the body with the conversion and have a lower toxicity level etc) plus remdesivir has many other drawbacks about how it is made and given to patients - a side by side study of the 2 drugs was the logical way forward. The question is why wasnt it done which no one is asking ? Finally as well lab tests in support of GC-376 human trials, the University of Alberta researchers (who look like they have done great work) stated “The fact that this drug [GC-376] has already been developed and shown to be successful in treating feline infectious peritonitis [a fatal cat coronavirus], it really bodes well,” Lemieux says. [GS-441524 was almost 100% effective so should have even more potential while GC-376 was only effective in about 35% of cases] Next to quickly answer your Gilead GS-441524 questions ""Critics say Gilead has blocked the use"" What specific critics? Where have they said this? What specific wording did they use? Below are some of the links I previously posted with quotes directly from those links (mostly already posted before)  on Gilead and GS-441524 and the direct and indirect blocking of research. Links and quotes to answer your questions above Gilead Sciences, Inc. and the federal government apparently have been sitting on a potentially promising coronavirus treatment (GS-441524) for months that may offer significant advantages over the closely related antiviral drug remdesivir, possibly to maximize profits, Public Citizen and two scientists specializing in cancer drug development said today [4th August] in a letter to the company and senior federal health officials. 4th August 2020 PDF of 9 page open letter and research to Gilead FDA etc - selected quotes It is unclear why Gilead and federal scientists have not been pursuing GS-441524 as aggressively as remdesivir, but the answer may be found in the corporation’s patent holdings, the letter said. Gilead holds patents on both agents, but the earliest patent approval date on remdesivir is 2015, whereas the earliest on GS-441524 is 2010. As a result, the corporation’s monopoly over remdesivir may last five years longer than that for GS-441524, allowing Gilead to make substantially greater profits from the sale of remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment. Conclusions GS-441524 is the parental nucleoside of remdesivir that has demonstrated strong anti-coronavirus activity in vitroand in vivo. GS-441524 further demonstrates comparable or superior anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity to remdesivir in vitro. Against a deadly coronavirus in cats, GS-441524 has yielded exceptional  cure  rates.  As  the  predominant  and  persistent(half-life equals24  hours)circulating metabolite  in  remdesivir-treated  patients,there  is  strong  scientific  justification  for  its  further investigation in clinical trials for COVID-19. We look forward to your prompt response to this letter with either a commitment and plan to pursue GS-441524 as a treatment for COVID-19, or supportable evidence of why it is necessary to defer development of this seemingly obvious drug candidate. Finally,if Gilead is unwilling to pursue further investigation and development of GS-441524, we request that the company immediately permit other academic and federal scientists to do so. Late August 2020 Public Citizen received a response letter from the director of the NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, Dr. Christopher Austin, on Aug. 22, stating that “Scientists in our Division of Preclinical Innovation have reviewed the literature and agree that [GS-441524] merits further exploration,” and that NIH scientists will quickly conduct preclinical studies of the drug. May 2020 The attractive profile of GS-441524 from both manufacturing and clinical perspectives raises this question: Why hasn’t Gilead opted to advance this compound to the clinic? We would be remiss for not mentioning patents, and thus profits. The first patent on GS-441524 was issued in 2009, while the first patent for remdesivir was issued in 2017. We aren’t the only ones questioning Gilead’s strategy. We have spoken with a number of chemists, biochemists, veterinarians, and others who are also surprised that GS-441524 has remained out of the spotlight. Veterinarians we spoke to have noted that the strong antiviral activity of GS-441524 has resulted in a “miraculous turn of events” for cats infected with feline coronavirus, which was once considered a death sentence. Given GS-441524’s optimal properties, we — along with the millions of people awaiting an effective treatment for Covid-19 — are left to wonder why Gilead isn’t giving it the same attention it is giving remdesivir. The world can only hope it isn’t for the sake of protecting its intellectual property. September 2020 - Kershaw, Cook & Talley The allegations Public Citizen brought forward concerning Gilead’s conduct with respect to Remdesivir and GS-441524 is remarkably similar to its alleged conduct in a lawsuit pending in San Francisco Superior Court on behalf of thousands of individuals represented by Kershaw, Cook & Talley and other law firms across the United States. In this lawsuit, plaintiffs allege that Gilead developed TDF-based drugs .........while it simultaneously developed TAF-based drugs proved to be safer and at least equally effective at much smaller doses. Gilead’s own studies demonstrated that TDF had a much higher risk of severe side effects, including bone loss and kidney failure. Gilead chose to sell TDF and kept TAF (the safer drug) off the market for nearly 15 years. Plaintiffs allege that this strategy was enacted solely to maximize Gilead’s profits and extend its patent protection for these life-saving drugs. Once the patent on TDF ran out, Gilead then came out with TAF and marketed it as a “new and improved” drug with fewer side effects than TDF. To date, almost 18,000 plaintiffs have filed lawsuits against Gilead, which have been consolidated in San Francisco Superior Court for pretrial discovery. October 2020 a separate lawsuit According to allegations raised in a product liability lawsuit recently filed by a group of 10 people, Gilead Sciences, Inc. allegedly sold inferior, potentially life-threatening HIV drugs knowing it had a safer formulation, in order to increase its profit margins at the expense of patients. See some of the specific petition claims below John Milligan, Gilead’s President and Chief Executive Officer, later admitted to investment analysts, the real reason Gilead abandoned the TAF design was that TAF was too different from TDF. Once Gilead’s first TDF product, Viread, was on the market, Gilead did not want to hurt TDF sales by admitting that its TDF-based products are unreasonably and unnecessarily unsafe. In addition, Gilead knew that by withholding the safer TAF design, it could extend the longevity of its HIV drug franchise and make billions two times over: first, with TDF medications until TDF patent expiration, which would begin by no later than 2018, and second, with TAF medications until TAF patent expiration as late as 2032. Only once Gilead realized billions in sales through most of the TDF patent life did it seek to market safer TAF-based versions of its HIV medications. See Gilead Press release August 2019 to VIN News Service for veterinarians See section starting ""Fate of legal drugs in the U.S."" A spokesperson for Gilead provided the following statement to VIN News: ""Gilead in the past has worked to make compounds with the potential to help animals available to developers with the expertise to advance medicines for veterinary use. This is why we shared GS-441524 with UC Davis to research its impact on feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). ""At this time, we are not providing GS-441524 to other parties until remdesivir has FDA approval. This is to avoid any interference with the regulatory process, which could risk the approval of remdesivir by the FDA to treat human patients with Ebola or other filoviruses. ""We are, however, exploring options that would allow us to share GS-441524 before the FDA review is complete."" [Gilead did nothing meaningful from August 2019 to August 2020] Summary of the Gilead GS-441524 posts to date In summary since  February 2020 and definitely by May 2020 researchers, including those from the University of Texas, have been pressing Gilead to allow full research into GS-441524 without getting a meaningful response or assistance from Gilead. In August the Public Citizen organization and researchers from the University of Texas wrote a joint detailed open letter to the FDA, Gilead and Dr Fauci etc asking why no research was being done despite GS-441524 having been well researched since 2009, and compared to Gileads other drug remdesivir was cheaper and simpler to make and give to patients, looked more effective than remdesivir and had proved effective in treating cats against 100% fatal coronavirus in both lab cats and trials on domestic pet cats (and had been preferred over remdesivir in the UC Davis trials cat trials which Gilead was involved with). It was noted in the research that remdesivir converts into GS-441524, and because of this GS-441524 is much less toxic than remdesivir, so it was doubly unclear why Gilead would want to not allow independent research on GS-441524 during this time of crisis or at any time, (unless it was about a financial issue). It seems clear if there was a problem with GS-441524 it would also equally apply in remdesivir - so surely Gilead would want everyone to know of any health issues ? Additionally in lab tests GS-441524 showed it was effective against SARS and MERS and looks effective against Covid-19 as it is the effective metabolite of remdesivir - ie what remdesivir converts into The FDA responded in late August to the Public Citizen letter saying that it would start research as the research has merit. However little of no real or meaningful updates have been released on what research is going to be done, or why it had not already started. There are very serious issues here about why Gilead has not allowed others to research GS-441524 or in any way promoted research along side remdesiver. That this is a real issue can be seen through the difference between how GC-376 owned by another company (Anivive) and GS-441524 has been dealt with - it highlights the concerns raised by independent researchers about the FDA and Gileads failure to research GS-441524 and Gileads' conduct on other drugs. GC-376 and GS-441524 were both tested in UC Davis trials From my other posts you will see that GC-376 is a very much less effective drug than GS-441524 GS-441524 was 100% effective in lab cat trials (96% in pet cats) while GC-376 was only about 35% effective lab cat trials Just to be clear GC-376 has never been approved for animal or human use and prior to Covid-19 the Anivive time line for GC-376 animal use was 5 to 10 years for FDA approval. However the article below shows GC-376 was fast tracked and being researched by the University of Alberta in March 2020 because its owner Anivive was supportive So University of Alberta did a great job on getting GC-376 fast tracked through 2 months of University studies and by August research reports were published - and it is stated that GC-376 is expected to shortly go to human trials in Canada and the US - but GS-441524 is left unresearched by Gilead or the FDA and University of Texas researchers are effectively blocked by Gilead (and the FDA ?) See article below [GC-376] ""Fast-tracked research leads to phase 1 clinical trials."" [GC-376] Antiviral used to treat cat coronavirus also works against SARS-CoV-2: U of A researchers The University of Alberta researchers have stated “The fact that this drug [GC-376] has already been developed and shown to be successful in treating feline infectious peritonitis [a fatal cat coronavirus], it really bodes well,” Lemieux says. [on that basis GS-441524 should be another even better candidate] Links to Anivive comments Gilead as a Corporate Gileads overall conduct on a range of issues has been questionable and shows the importance of acting properly, which can create long term financial value or failing to do so may result in a damaging of value or the creating of huge problems Gilead may have damaged itself by its actions, and certainly has had its ethical position called into doubt which cannot be good for any company but especially so for a health related company which is being accused of acting in a manner that disregards human and animal life These suggestions are based on quotes or claims set out publicly in,  court filings about Gilead withholding better drugs for profit and at the risk of peoples health or even possibly their lives, press comments by Gilead about not allowing research and development or sale of drugs that cure animals, open letters to Gilead about not allowing or blocking the use of GS-441524 to save animal lives or for human research in favor of  another unproven and almost identical drug (remdesivir), litigation over Gileads use of federal funds and research facilities and then Gilead seeking exclude the FDA from patents on several occasions, litigation against Gilead for withholding drugs that are better to increase their profits this at the cost of peoples health etc. Gilead in Patent disputes with FDA over other drugs and possibly over remdesivir (please review the previous older posts back to the 28th August and other separate posts for more info and links) GS-441524 Effectively Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mice Models doi: October 27, 2020. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spreads across worldwide and becomes a global pandemic. Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, its effectiveness is still under questioning as raised by the results of a large WHO Solidarity Trial. Herein, we report that the parent nucleotide of remdesivir, GS-441524, potently inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Vero E6 and other cells. It exhibits good plasma distribution and longer half-life (t1/2=4.8h) in rat PK study. GS-441524 is highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 in AAV-hACE2 transduced mice and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in mice, reducing the viral titers in CoV-attacked organs, without noticeable toxicity. Given that GS-441524 was the predominant metabolite of remdesivir in the plasma, the anti-COVID-19 effect of remdesivir may partly come from the effect of GS-441524. Our results also supported that GS-441524 as a promising and inexpensive drug candidate in the treatment of COVID-19 and future emerging CoVs diseases. Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. Still no updates from Gilead on when GS-441524 will be researched The Texas Uni info from researchers meeting with Gilead show Gilead  will not progress despite good data and Remdesivir removed as covid treatment by FDA They also told us that they want to focus on new, lung-targeted prodrug of remdesivir. They didn’t seem to want to move GS-441524 in parallel, even with all this data/human experience w it. Might be relying on NCATS to move GS-441524 forward for them, my guess... In private meetings with us, Gilead showed data from SARS-CoV-2 challenge experiments in NHP for RDV (10 mpk loading + 5 mpk ) vs. GS-441524 (20 mpk) for 5 days. Same reduction in viral titers for both. Advantages w '524 is higher and safer dosing + can be orally administered. It's all about numbers of years of exclusivity. Why is GILEAD hiding its own latest GS-441524 research and other mice trial data showing GS-441524s effectiveness against Covid19. No GILEAD media  or press release ""Metabolite GS-441524 Efficiently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mouse Model,"" Only veterinarian news service VIN NEWS and a medical blog is reporting this good news . What is going on ? Why is nothing being done? VIN NEWS reports Texas Uni researchers study that GS-441524 is likely very effective against Covid19 and also much less toxic than Remdesivir is borne out by study but not reported. FDA/NIH confirmed in August  GS-441524 should be researched as an independent Covid19 treatment Plus GS-441524 is more easily synthesized and can be taken orally or by aerosol delivery. Research  shows ""GS-441524 can be present in the serum at concentrations 1,000-fold higher than remdesivir ( )."" Remdesivir is delivered intravenously. A search of Gileads own website fails to show this positive Gilead research on GS-441524 despite the VIN pdf showing all authors work or worked for Gilead, may have stock options and address for correspondence is Joy Y. Feng Still no mainstream reporting on Gilead or NIH human trials and other testing of GS-441524. New study ""Metabolite GS-441524 Efficiently Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Mouse Model,"" was released online as a preprint on the bioRxiv* server, prior to undergoing the peer-review process. ""Given the efficacy of GS-441524 in the treatment of [fatal conronavirus] FIP, it has been suggested that there may be advantages to the use of the parent (GS-441524), rather than the prodrug (remdesivir) in human trials ( ). Remdesivir appears to be rapidly metabolized in the serum to GS-441524 rather than entering cells intact ( , ), and GS-441524 can be present in the serum at concentrations 1,000-fold higher than remdesivir ( )."" pdf copy of recent Gilead tests on GS-441524 and Remdesivir provided by VIN NEWS Prospective FIP drugs may benefit from COVID-19 research In the years since a Gilead Sciences antiviral drug was shown to reverse the progression of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a cadre of veterinarians and cat owners have to bring it to market for veterinary use. While neither public cajoling nor a thriving black market in knockoffs have persuaded Gilead to act, the COVID-19 pandemic might. The reason is that the drug, named GS-441524, is being investigated as a possible treatment for COVID-19. GS, as it's known for short, is closely related to remdesivir, an antiviral compound also made by Gilead that was the (on a limited, emergency basis) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19. Both COVID-19 and FIP are caused by coronaviruses. In August, an official at the National Institutes of Health said government scientists would investigate GS as a treatment for COVID-19. If fully approved for humans, GS could at some point be available for veterinarians to use off-label for cats with FIP. The push to appraise GS as a COVID-19 treatment came from a pair of researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center: Florian Muller, an assistant professor, and graduate student Victoria Yan. In a by the American Chemical Society, they make a case, based on laboratory analysis, that GS is comparable if not superior to remdesivir in acting against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Yan told the VIN News Service that Gilead had shared data with her showing that GS has essentially equal potency as remdesivir in reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in primates. The authors maintain that GS is also less toxic than remdesivir. (That claim is borne out by .) GS is more easily synthesized, they say, and should be more conducive to oral or aerosol delivery. Remdesivir is delivered intravenously. In to various chiefs at federal health agencies and Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day, Yan and Muller, joined by the consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen, pressed the company and the government to ""promptly pursue"" the development of GS as a treatment for COVID-19 ""or publicly provide evidence why it is not scientifically or medically feasible ..."" The authors question whether Gilead's actions are driven only by profit: ""It is unclear why Gilead and federal scientists have not been pursuing GS-441524 as aggressively as remdesivir, but we cannot help but note that there are significant financial incentives tied to Gilead's current patent holdings. Specifically, Gilead holds patents on both agents, but the earliest patent approval date on remdesivir is 2015 whereas the earliest on GS-441524 is 2010. Thus, Gilead's monopoly power over remdesivir may have at least five additional years of enforceability beyond that of GS-441524."" In response to questions about the Yan and Muller study, Gilead spokesperson Chris Ridley told VIN News in November that the company prioritized remdesivir over GS for several reasons, including evidence indicating remdesivir is more effective in test tubes and animal models than GS in blocking viral replication; and a finding that remdesivir was more active in lab tests against multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. ""Reinforcing this decision was the ability to rapidly progress clinical trials with remdesivir, given the urgency of the global pandemic,"" Ridley said by email. ""Remdesivir had already been tested in human clinical trials, including both in healthy volunteers and as a potential treatment for Ebola virus disease; the safety data from these studies allowed us to quickly begin clinical trials in patients with COVID-19."" He pointed out that there are no formal toxicology studies on GS at dosing levels required to demonstrate efficacy in humans, and added that existing stockpiles of remdesivir supported ""the rapid initiation of clinical trials and compassionate use."" While prioritizing remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in humans, Gilead is exploring options to work with other parties on further assessment of GS, and pursuing options for out-licensing GS for veterinary use, according to Ridley. Sixteen days after the Texas researchers' letter was sent, Dr. Christopher Austin, director of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences at the NIH, affirmed in a response to Yan, Muller and Public Citizen that GS deserved a closer look. ""We are planning to independently test the therapeutic hypothesis for GS-441524 in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection ..."" he wrote, saying he expected the preclinical studies to be conducted quickly. A second company with a promising FIP treatment also is pivoting to target COVID-19. The veterinary biotech company Anivive Lifesciences that it was ""repurposing"" its veterinary drug GC376 as a COVID-19 therapy. GC376 showed promise as a treatment for FIP in a published in 2017. Pet owners have told VIN News they used black-market versions of GC376 to successfully reverse FIP in their cats. However, GS generally is considered more effective against the disease and appears to dominate black-market use. In its May announcement, Anivive said it remained dedicated to developing GC376 for veterinary patients. is a good link from Texas Univ researchers showing why GS-441524 so effective against Covid-19 compared to Remdesivir Basically Gilead wont address what's the point of using complex Remdesivir when GS-441524 is what reaches the lungs and is what combats Covid19? Also Remdesivir is much more toxic. GS-441524 can be given in much higher doses directly Remdesivir really seems to make little logical sense when compared to GS-441524. Gilead continues to ignor GS-441524 despite more and new positive studies on the ease of use, effectiveness and cost benefit of GS-441524 plus the WHO saying Remdesivir is not effective against Covid-19 and the FDA changing its treatment status New Study on Orally Administered GS-441524 in Dogs to treat Covid-19 This study on dogs indicates GS-441524 could potentially be developed as pill and orally available against COVID-19 on an outpatient basis. GS-441524 is much less susceptible to COVID-19 mutations than is the spike protein. In cell cultures, the activity of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found to be a quick acting long lasting and powerfully inhibitory. “As a prodrug inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GS-441524 is aptly poised to demonstrate consistent efficacy among new mutations of SARS-CoV-2, as RdRp is much less susceptible to efficacy-altering mutations than is the spike protein.” These results have driven the current study on the pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 in dogs, since they indicate that this drug could potentially be developed as an orally available agent against COVID-19 on an outpatient basis. In mouse studies, using either SARS-CoV-2 or murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is closely related to the former, GS-441524 has been found to reduce viral loads in affected organs with encouragingly low toxicity levels. In cats, naturally infected with the feline coronavirus (FCoV), and showing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), the use of GS-441524 subcutaneously has shown a cure rate of 96%. *Important Notice bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Studies continue to show the low toxicity of GS-441524 at doses far higher than Remdesivir could ever be consider, plus GS-441524 starts acting sooner and lasts longer in the lungs Journal reference: Yan, V. C. et al. (2021). Pharmacokinetics of Orally Administered GS-441524 in Dogs. bioRxiv preprint. doi: , Still no news on GS-441524 from the FDA.  Strange how Dr Fauci was so quick to test and back Remdesivir also by Gilead but fails to do so despite FDA saying  in Sept 2020 GS-441524 should be quickly tested as the studies were very promising and is the key anti covid-19 metabolite of remdesivir and appears much more potent. Gilead continues to promote remdesivir despite FDA withdrawing its covid-19 treatment status ide Hooray for continued development of antivirals for !

Gilead owns both remdesivir (GS-5734) its Covid-19 treatment and the drug GS-441524 which was also successful against SARS and MERS GS-441524 is the main metabolite of Remdesivir - effectively the main anti Covid-19 compound Gilead has blocked all use of GS-441524 on animals or people. Someone needs to look into this as even the FDA has admitted in writing that long standing research on GS-441524 shows lots of merit for a potentional Covid-19 treatment. Gilead and the FDA need to answer questions on what is going on particularly as Uni of Texas researchers have indicated that GS-441524 could be more effective than remdesivir against Covid-19 and cheaper and easier to produce.

Lemieux said it will likely be tested in Alberta in combination with other promising antivirals such as remdesivir, the first treatment approved for conditional use in some countries including the United States and Canada. “In just two months, our results have shown that the drug is effective at inhibiting viral replication in cells with SARS-CoV-2,” said Joanne Lemieux, a professor of biochemistry in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/covid-19-and-long-distance-relationship.3669/,Covid-19 and Long Distance Relationship,"Hello, my girlfried and I live in a long-distance-relationship where we sometimes don't meet for weeks. Since the corona outbreak, we've both been very careful, wear masks in public and shifted 90% of our work to home-office. Lately, after we hadn't seen each other for a while, she got sick at her place, had herself tested for Covid-19 ... and the test was positive After one week of really feeling severly ill (not life-threatening though), she is slowly getting better, but still self-quarantaining at her place, with running nose remaining and the frightening aspect of having completely lost her sense of smell and most of her sense of taste. Meanwhile me, hundreds of miles away, luckily still 100% symptom free all over this time, without being tested, however. (Actually she likely got her infection long after we met the last time) Now we do not really know how to handle this entire situation, especially when to meet again??? Local health department tells her, she'd be absolutely negative and 100% non-contageous as soon as 24h after her running nose (or other symptoms, apart from the not smelling which doesn't count as infecteous) have dissappeared. Can anyone confirm that? It's a weird situation when the only person in the world that you personally know has this infamous Covid, is your girlfriend who you wanna kiss, share the same bed and be together with... I personally must admit that I'm afraid of that virus, both for me (probably not having had it yet) and of course for my girlfriend where it hopefully doesn't do any damage on the long run. So I have a collection of questions: A few studies have shown that sars-cov-2 patients are no longer infectious after around day 8 of symptoms. I would think 10 days would be a decent time period to assume this, or to be extra cautious you could wait 14 days. After this time period, the patient will still most likely be shedding virus, in the sense that it can be picked up by pcr test, and so might test positive for coronavirus. However, this does not necessarily mean that they are still infectious. That is the reason why you are asked to isolate for 14 days -because the pcr test cannot determine the stage of your infection, only that you have the presence of virus rna in your sample. Therefore a second test is probably not going to be very helpful, especially considering that you say they are difficult to get for her. Basically, after 14 days you should be ok. Somebody with antibodies may become reinfected with a different strain. We have seen a small number of cases around the world. Its hard to say just now how common place this is, and whether these cases were outliers. My advice to you is not to worry about the objects in the apartment. Sars-cov-2 is a rsspiratory infection that is predominantly spread through close contact with an infected person. The risk of infection through inanimate objects, was slightly exagerrated during the early days of the pandemic and research has shown that the infectious state of the virus does not survive for longer than a day or so on objects. Just wash the sheets and maintain good housekeeping as normal, you dont need to go crazy with a deep clean. I hope that this helps to reassure you somewhat, but i encourage you to verify my advice with your own research. This is how i would personally respond if i was in your situation. Today some new research was widely reported in the press that offered a new understanding of the above, previously understood from a study posted to the CDC website ( ). The recent out of Australia, found viable infectious sars-cov-2 to persist for at least 28 days on non-porous materials (glass, polymer note, stainless steel, vinyl and paper notes), and 14 days on porous cotton cloth. All experiments were conducted in the dark so such viability may not be observed in the real world conditions. In spite of what may be considered alarming news, infection from objects (fomite transmission) is still considered to be for sars-cov-2 in comparision to the airborne and droplet routes. Hey, thank you so far for those detailed answers Today,  however, I'm still anxious here: Actually, we want to meet again the upcoming weekend, her running nose has finally recovered, but she still (even after a total of 5 weeks) has completely loss of smell, which is very sad (as it is supposed to recover within 2-4 weeks on average). And as for me, I'm afraid if this might still make her contageous to me... in terms of if there are still rests of the virus (causing this anosmia) which could be infectious. As far as i know, the cause of the loss of smell isnt fully understood, but it is for sure a highly specific symptom of covid. There is some thought that it may be a neurological effect of infection, and alternatively some research pointing to infection of non-neural cells in the nose. Either way, this condition may be as short as a few weeks or may persist for longer, perhaps in some cases be permanent. Viruses can cause damage to different cell types during an infection, that can remain long after the infection has been cleared and this may cause some disruption to normal function as the damage is repaired. As i said in my initial reply, the contagious phase of infection has been observed to be last around 10 days after symptom onset. After 5 weeks, you should have confidence that she is no longer infectious to you, and she is now even beyond the usual time for virus to still be shedding in the respiratory tract at this point. A runny nose is a common symptom to many common cold and flu-like virus infections so its possible that she has picked up another bug thats been going around since recovery. Although you said that it would be hard to get tested again, i feel like a negative test result is the only thing that will settle your anxiety, so it might be something you want to consider. A paper released earlier this week, reviewed the studies on the duration of viral shedding and of the viability of infectious virus in this period. They found: ""The pooled median duration of RNA shedding from respiratory samples of subjects was ; In reviewed studies, viable virus from respiratory cultures was not recovered past of illness for but was cultured from through "" ... ""Only one study reported culturing viable virus from a respiratory sample beyond the second week of illness. Based on this information, ."" I hope that this will help you make a more informed decision in your situation I've been a mess. I'm stressed and my depression has kicked in again (it was finally going okay) but I'm trying to recognize my emotions are going haywire and trying not to get upset over little things. Luckily I got upset the other day and he called me on it and (very kindly) asked were my reaction was coming from because it was a huge overreaction on my part to something that I shouldn't have gotten upset about at all. Hes patient with me, and even though hes stressed as well and has his bad days too we are making it work. Let's hope all this virus lockdown stuff is over soon. I appreciate you have asked a few questions but just for my clarification- You have been advised by a medical professional that is registered under the appropriate regulatory body and have their position. As you are unsure, you want further guidance from a community of people you do not know, many of whom have posted conspiracy theories or unreliable/ outdated sources."

Personally I am a survivor of two ""silent killers"", HCV and liver cancer, requiring a transplant which I was blessed to receive - albeit this now makes me high risk for COVID-19. It is apparent that the lack of testing and PPE equipment poses health risks to Americans and will contribute to the spread. Large chain stores, factories, etc do not have the resources to regularly test employees. Based on the published info, the virus is mostly spread via airborne moisture particles. Larger particles will fall to the floor, smaller ones will dissipate with a short time. While they can survive for days on surfaces, it is less likely to infect someone - I would assume that you must get the virus on your hand(s), then touch your eyes, nose or mouth. Thinking logically - hypothetically assume a large dept store, 50 employees, average 500 customers daily. At close, the entire store is sanitized. What about the HVAC systems? Wouldn't some airborne particles end up in the filtering and ductwork? I am not suggesting this as a scare scenario, that these particles could be re-circulated. Rather I see this as a possibility for prevention. I may be wrong, I am not a medical expert. But if it is possible to test surfaces for the presence of virus, why couldn't the surfaces of HVAC be tested? Possible some inline cooling filter could collect and retain moisture, placed in front of existing filters. IMHO, it is at least worth some testing for viability. If successful, for example stores could get a single test weekly, if no virus detected that's one test vs. fifty. If virus is detected, then employees could be tested, as well the extensive CCTV and receipt tracking could help identify customers possibly exposed. Well, apparently a US company has already invented and marketed air testing equipment for coronavirus. Only selling to foreign countries however. The referenced article says more than I ccould ever hope to point out about PCR testing. ""So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity? Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding."" - excerpted from COVID19 PCR Tests Are Scientifically Meaningless by Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter"

The info has been updated in the link below Why does it take a citizens advocacy group to get the FDA to do the right thing and investigate GS-441524 The FDA have now “reviewed the literature and agree that this compound merits further exploration,” This info has been around for a long time “We are planning to independently test the therapeutic hypothesis for GS-441524 in treating SARS-CoV-2, [which causes Covid-19], and have informed our colleagues at [the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] about our plans for preclinical studies. We expect to conduct these studies quickly and make the results available to the research community for further consideration,” the agency said in the letter Researchers are still seeking permission from Gilead to use data on the compound that is on file with the FDA. Below is a link to the updated story Some say Gilead has blocked research into a potentially much cheaper and better Covid-19 treatment that Gilead also has patent rights over for financial reasons The FDA has just accepted that the longstanding research shows the drug merits further investigation as a Covid-19 treatment and will begin to do do The updated info is in the link immediately below Decide for yourself Gilead has declined to comment on The Atlantic story which is partly about the amazing cure GS-441524 has been for a near 100% fatal coronavirus in cats and partly about Gilead blocking research and licensing the manufacture and use of GS-441524 in cats and people as a treatment for Covid-19 and other coronaviruses. Thank you. There are separate posts on other drugs which show good results against Covid-19 Also a post that compares GS-441524 research to another similar drug that only had about a 35% coronavirus cure rate  GC-376 - GC-376 is owned by another company and also  never approved for human or animal use However GC-376 months ago  finished Covid-19 University trials with an application for speedy human trials in Canada and the USA expected to be granted shortly partly based on studies showing a 35% cure rate of coronavirus in cats Both drugs had been researched and tested by UC Davies over some years with GS-441524 having a near 100% cure rate and being used unofficially extensively to cure pet cats See links below Another separate post links to press statements made by Gilead from 2019 saying they wont allow use, development or research of GS-441524 in humans or animals until after Remdesivir has been approved by the FDA. As of early August 2020 nothing had been done and no real updates have been released on how Gilead will cooperate with other researchers on GS-441524 This NIH link on GS-441524 below worked for a short while in October then stopped. Might be a temporary problem. It detailed data about studies of GS-441524 The search originally came up with the data below NCATS is conducting studies to assess the oral bioavailability of GS-441524 as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV2 infection. Sample Information. Sample Name. GS-441524. NCATS ID. NCGC00686670-1. PubChem SID. 44468216. Molecular Weight. 291.26. Also unclear if the study below for remdesivir+ is for GS-441524 or remdesivir There are also updates after the date of the the post you replied to which details issues connected to Gilead - a current legal case in the USA where Gilead is accused by 18,000 people in court filings of withholding a better safer drug for 15 years so as to have a replacement drug in the future. The legal case claim is Gilead withheld the better drug patent so as not to compete with a much more toxic drug. Both drugs were developed at the same time. Gilead all the time had the test data showing which drug was safer and how the more toxic released drug caused harm and even death. Once the more toxic drug patent expired 15 years later - Gilead then released the safer drug as a new safer version of the previous treatment. Gilead is accused of putting profit over safety and health."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/covid-19-acquired-adenosine-deaminase-2-deficiency.2635/,Covid-19 Acquired Adenosine Deaminase 2 Deficiency?,"COVID-19 is increasingly associated with peculiar observations such as teenage strokes, child Kawasaki Disease, multi-organ involvement, immune, thrombocytopenia and clotting irregularities, inflammation and, of course, cough and hypoxia. I’d like to make the case for Virally Acquired Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency and closely associated enzyme irregularities in Covid-19. The enzymes I propose to be involved are closely biologically or physically coupled. DPPIV/CD26 is membrane bound by Adenosine Deaminase 2 whilst the latter is closely biologically coupled to the activities of Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase. Adenosine status regulates all three. I propose the problem can be explained by Acquired Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency (which could be because the virus retains the ability to target DPPIV which is membrane bound by Adenosine Deaminase 2 as per SARS and MERS). Did we take our eye off the ball as soon as ACE2 became implicated as a receptor? Blacks and Asians have a high incidence of Glucose 6 phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and the UK ‘BAME’ population are 3x more likely to be admitted to hospital even though the smoke half as much as Whites and Mixed. G6PD Deficiency promotes endothelial oxidative stress and decreased endothelial vasodilatory Nitric Oxide availability (note Nitric Oxide showing promise as a therapy). G6PD is also deeply implicated in Kawasaki Disease, (for example: ) as associated with Covid-19 in children and the Lividoid rash common to both. G6PD is one step away from Adenosine Deaminase which also results in platelet abnormalities. Both enzymes cause a condition called Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. Lack of DPPIV (also known as CD26 and is an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) can lead to vascular permeability because it does not deactivate Substance P (or Bradykinin responsible for cough). I have put together a basic video (below) to draw attention to DPPIV/CD26 and Adenosine Deaminase 2 as ‘Ground Zero’. No dispute that ACE2 is involved and disruption would certainly also reduce the expression and activity of DPPIV. Adenosine receptors also produce surfactant in Alveoli and a back-up in processing Adenosine Diphosphate would explain low platelet count and aggregation. Perhaps the most interesting point of all is that Adenosine converts to Inosine only in Hypoxic conditions and it serves as a key counter-regulator of hypoxia. This appears mostly due to vascular tone and a direct effect on levels of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate which facilitates Haemogloin release of oxygen to hypoxic tissues. It appears severe covid-19 patients are relying upon an evolutionary-conserved bio-mechanism that ordinarily isn’t needed because Adenosine Deaminase serves that function without need to reach hypoxic levels. The biology is entirely related to respiration, oxidative stress control, electron transport, inflammation and Immune modulation. DPPIV/ CD26 and Adenosine Deaminase are the perfect place to start if you wanted to engineer a disease like Covid-19. I’m not supportive of the idea that it has been bio-engineered but if there were only one enzyme one could attack it would have to be Adenosine Deaminase 2 because DPPIV/CD26 also depends upon it and it has other effects, the second choice would be ACE2. Type 2 Diabetics have a head start because they tend to be taking DPPIV inhibitors already and have other related glucose and hypertensive issues. My single-handed progress so far: An in-depth understanding of the mechanism that SARS-CoV2 uses will lead to therapies. My current target — subject to confirmation — is myo-inositol which is otherwise considered to be non-essential but that’s different if both G6PD and Adenosine Deaminase pathways are disrupted. My hope is that others will agree that the evidence points towards the described deficiencies and that will lead to increased focus in this particular area. Please share this with any interested physician or scientist. having a limited knowledge of medical terminology does not make be dumber than the next person and with that in mind I could be mistaken that this virus likes the bodies response to the digestion of a full meal if you know what I mean to try and combat this virus I would suggest limits of sugar and carbohydrates because I have herd.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/vitamin-d-and-coronavirus.2305/,Vitamin D and Coronavirus,"With the world’s attention focused on COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, people with arthritis might wonder if there is something that protects them from getting infected. The internet has many remedies and recommendations – many unproven and a few downright dangerous. But some have potential benefit, whether you’re already sick or trying to stay healthy. This is especially true of vitamins and minerals, which are essential in supporting a healthy immune system. While no pill or food can prevent COVID-19, certain supplements may help your ability to stay healthy or recover faster. Vitamin D, commonly known for its role in bone health, also helps make proteins that kill viruses and bacteria, especially in the respiratory tract. In a 2019 analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving more than 11,000 patients, vitamin D supplements significantly reduced respiratory infections in people deficient in the vitamin and lowered the risk in those with normal levels. Benefits were greatest when people took vitamin D daily or weekly, rather in a single large dose, echoing the findings of other studies. Tod Cooperman, MD, president of the independent supplement testing company, Consumerlab.com, recommends 2,000 IU (50 mcg) of vitamin D a day, preferably in liquid form. But Daniel Small, MD, a rheumatologist with the Mayo Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin, says many people with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other autoimmune diseases may need to take much higher doses under a doctor's supervision. Nobel Prize-winner Linus Pauling championed vitamin C as a cold cure decades ago, but research remains mixed. Some studies suggest that taking 500 mg twice daily can help prevent colds but not cure them. Other research has found that vitamin C may not prevent viral respiratory infections but can speed recovery.  Not in dispute: Vitamin C is vital for the function of leukocytes – white blood cells that help fight infections – and you need a lot more when you’re sick. There’s some evidence that it may help with certain symptoms that develop in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis). Doctors in China are experimenting with intravenous vitamin C for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. While vitamin C doesn’t build up in your body, a daily dose of 2,000 mg or more could cause diarrhea. Decades of research have shown that zinc lozenges can shorten colds by 20% to 40%. This seems to hold true for both low and high doses – 80 mg to over 200 mg a day – and for different forms, including gluconate, sulfate, acetate and picolinate. Zinc works best if you start it at the first sign of symptoms. Doctors are taking a closer look at zinc for COVID-19, too. Pathologist and virologist James Robb, MD, who was among the first to study coronaviruses, writes that zinc can prevent them from “multiplying in your nose and pharynx.” But he also stresses that taking zinc is no “guarantee against being infected by the virus.” Other doctors say there’s not enough evidence to know for sure. Zinc supplements come in lozenge, pill or liquid form. Consumerlab.com recommends taking a lozenge containing 13 mg to 23 mg zinc every two hours throughout the day for no more than a week if you have a cold. (Those without symptoms may not get any benefit.) Too much zinc can have the opposite effect and blunt your immune response and can cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea and headache. The National Institutes of Health sets the daily maximum limit at 40 mg day, unless being advised to take more under medical supervision. It’s also important to talk to your doctor before supplementing with zinc – too much can interact with various prescription medications. If your doctor gives you the go ahead, avoid zinc nasal spray, which a decade ago was linked to loss of smell, and choose lozenges that don’t contain citric acid, which can diminish its effectiveness. Thousands of different chemicals known as polyphenols are found naturally in plants, including most fruits and vegetables as well as coffee beans, cocoa, nuts, green tea and extra virgin olive oil. Polyphenols are anti-inflammatory and may protect against a broad range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and disorders that affect the brain, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease.  In lab (not human) studies, they’ve also been found to kill coronaviruses. One polyphenol – quercetin – proved especially effective against infections similar to COVID-19. Quercetin seems to work by preventing viruses from entering cells. A clinical trial of quercetin is underway in China. In human research, polyphenols from green tea and blueberries helped prevent viral respiratory infections in athletes. You can buy polyphenol supplements or specific types, such as quercetin, but Dr. Cooperman at Consumerlab.com says it’s not yet known what type of quercetin or dose might be effective against the new coronavirus. This mineral won’t prevent COVID-19 but could play a life-saving role in treating it.  The new coronavirus causes low potassium levels because it blocks an enzyme called ACE2 that regulates blood pressure by balancing potassium and sodium. Potassium loss can be especially severe in COVID-19 patients with heart disease or high blood pressure.  If you have mild respiratory symptoms, potassium probably won’t help. Still, only about 2% of American adults get enough. Experts recommend getting potassium from food instead of supplements, which could be dangerous for certain groups of people, including (but not limited to) those with kidney or heart disease and those who take particular blood pressure medications. Potatoes, lentils, beans, squash and dried fruit are good sources. There’s evidence in both animals and humans that probiotics containing and strains can improve your immune response to viruses and reduce the severity and duration of respiratory infections. In a Cochrane review of 12 randomized controlled trials, probiotics cut the number of respiratory infections nearly in half. When people did get sick, they recovered almost two days sooner than those who didn’t take probiotics – however, the authors caution many of the trials were poorly conducted. You can find probiotics in kefir, yogurt and fermented foods like miso and sauerkraut (look for unpasteurized products sold in the refrigerated sections of your supermarket). But supplements are probably the best way to get the amount needed to fight infections. Many probiotics are heat-sensitive and should be refrigerated, both at home and in the store where you buy them. Look for brands that have been independently tested by a third party for purity and potency. When shopping for supplements, it’s important to remember that not all are created equal. Unlike drug manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require supplement makers to prove their product is safe or effective before selling them. For tips on choosing safe, quality supplements, click . Again, always talk to your doctor before starting a new supplement. Your doctor can help you choose the right product and dose as well as help you avoid any potential medication side effects. There is one supplement (lozenge) called Phytorelief-cc that seems to work wonders for flu or cold. I used to catch a virus on every flight and also catch one frequently at parties if there was anybody in the room with a respiratory infection.  After I started taking it just before a flight or a party, I never caught one.  It also gets rid of the infection (if I neglected to take one) with only one to two of the lozenges and makes me symptom-free in about 30 minutes. So it seems like a cure as well as a preventive. Several reviews confirmed its performance. I gave it to two relatives who came down with an infection and it worked instantly. Its main ingredients are turmeric and ginger extracts. I don't know if it will work for coronavirus. I suspect it would work as a preventive or may reduce the severity of the infection. I asked the supplier if it would work for coronavirus and I got no response. Perhaps it does not work or they never tested it and because it is sold as a supplement they cannot claim it as a cure for anything even though the ads imply so.  For me, the only time it did not work as a cure was for whooping cough. It would calm down the cough quite a bit but did not get rid of it permanently after taking 2 or 3 doses 6 hours apart as recommended. I am keeping a few handy if I or someone in the family, heavens forbid, get hit by the virus, and then publish the result. this is a SCIENCE site. testimonials like harpat949 mean nothing and give people false hopes. they may delay proper treatment or even let them believe they are not a danger to others. vit D toxicity is not mentioned  also and is a serious risk. besides there is no solid evidence that or the other vitico stuff works.... period with a name like vitico is that person a shill for those things? gasman117 I agree with disliking testimonials. But your fear of vitamin D is close to a testimonial... You  need to search hard to actually find case reports of vitamin D toxicity. It is not a serious risk and the risk is greatly exaggerated. There are no published cases or side effects attributable to Vitamin D toxicity if an adult takes less than 50,000 IU PER DAY for months. There are case reports where children in a study were mistakenly given several million units per day - those did have sx (kidney problems which led to the discovery) but no permanent damage. A couple of expert bodies in the UK recently found no evidence that taking Vit D supplements is effective in the prevention or treatment of coronavirus. Vitamin D may be in the process of being categorized as a hormone and not a vitamin.

Our unit in a condo is independent from others in the Condo but how about are nursing homes.  Could the virus be spread by HVAC system and impact this high risk group or even be the cause of its prevalence in nursing homes and impacting the health care worker as  well as the patients...... I think it is very logical to think HVAC is a major contributor to infections in nursing homes and I would say it borders on criminal neglect. Unfortunately,  some of the people in authority have turned a blind eye to many articles, reports, literature affirming coronavirus can be spread by air, and HVAC can spread the infection. Even the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE has clearly stated that the virus can be spread by HVAC. They don't recommend turning off the HVAC with a flimsy excuse that the discomfort may be harmful to health. We are after all capitalists. But just turning off the AC may not solve the problem completely. The airborne virus can travel from one room to another via the hallway through diffusion and air currents caused by opening and closing doors and people movement. The Vietnamese are very smart in this respect according to one source. They use only natural ventilation even in hospitals and have 1000 times lower infection rates USA vs Vietnam. In fact, all the poor undeveloped countries have orders of magnitude lower infection rates because they cannot afford HVAC. Their shopping places are primitive like the farmer's market and street hawkers. Attached are some typical pictures from the internet, showing how people shop and what I mean by open ventilation. The nursing home management is very poor. Residents don't go out, so the attendants are probably bringing the infections in.  I was unable to bring this up to the powers there are. There is so much arrogance there. Common norm wre you dreaming the experts say it virus can't fly through the air or maybe it mutated with wings It depends on the type of air conditioning used. If it is replacing the air, it would probably be useful in mitigating the spread -especially of the airborne particles that hang around. Systems that recirculate the air may contribute to spread if there is no accompanying fresh air ventilation Yes which is why governors requiring nursing homes to take covid patients rises to domestic terrorism"

According to the CDC, around 2,000 Americans have died from Covid-19 in the 35-44 age group. This is in comparison to only 234 influenza deaths for that same age group. . To me, that seems like a pretty alarming amount of deaths, but maybe I am missing something? Does anyone know if there is an estimate for number of infected people in that age range (thousands, millions)?  I believe the CDC reported something like a .3% infection fatality rate overall. Just curious what your thoughts were on the fatality risks to infected people in that age range. Trying to get a grip on this. I appreciate any feedback! I think covid-19 is very serious and all steps should be taken to social distance wear masks etc however it can be controlled and probably eleminated by medicine and quarantine etc Taiwan and New Zealand have shown this Its very hard to get a proper picture of what the covid data really means because its been political from the start in the USA and Europe (as well as China) Data You mentioned the CDC influenza death data. I suggest it is important to compare influenza deaths this year to previous years. If these figures are roughly the same then the data may be ok. However if influenza deaths this year are much lower then it would imply that influenza deaths are now being classified under covid-19 which has been allowed. Death reporting changes in April allowed a death to be registered as covid rather than another illness even if there is no covid testing done and a person died of something else such as a heart attack etc. I provide the links on that at the end. These changes have been swept under the carpet. 60+ Age Group Data Factors The covid % death rate in the 60+ group is clearly much higher than the rest of the population particularly if there is another coexisting condition. Data on Younger People The data shows younger people have a lower the % death rate That does not mean young people wont get ill which may have serious long term health consequences - info on brain and lung damage seems to be coming up now So everyone should fight covid if only for their own health even if they dont care about the greater good Data Overview Looking at a CDC % avg death rate for the whole population is a bit meaningless if you want to understand your own age group death risk. Added to this the % death rate may be overstated for reasons set out below and not discussed much Death Rate Infection fatality rate is deaths in cases tested positive and cases that may or probably involve covid-19 (no testing proof required) divided by total of cases tested positive. However it seems reasonably clear that the level of infection is much higher - many studies have shown this - the latest info I found  easily is below and says covid infection (not death) could be up to 13 x more than is being reported via testing. This means that in reality the % agerage death rate is probably the same as flu as covid is much more widely spread and not seasonal / continues in the summer so the absolute number of deaths will be higher but skewed to the 60+ The number of deaths in 100s or 1000s from covid-19 is probably not much higher than is being reported otherwise we would be seeing a much higher overall death rate in the country for all deaths compared to previous years which is not happening - yes the death rate is higher but not hugely higher. Ses data below Covid-19 Reporting of Untested Deaths as Covid Deaths info below The rules for what is classified as a covid death were widened in April to include anyone who had died and the Dr believes could have had covid even if they die of something else and no test has been carried out. It is often not clear if the data is a possible covid death without testing or a death with a covid test What this probably means is that people who would have died later of a heart attack died of the heart attack now brought on by covid so it was classified as a covid induced heart attack (without testing for covid etc). If this is correct in future years we may see a fall in heart attack rates because of covid deaths now etc - what does that really mean ? The link below explains how probable deaths are included.  There was a World Health Organization reporting change that brought in probable covid. Why not split out the data by age group whether there was testing and what other major conditions were present or at least record and provide this data ? A confirmed case or death is defined by meeting confirmatory laboratory evidence for COVID-19. A probable case or death is defined by i) meeting clinical criteria AND epidemiologic evidence with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19; or ii) meeting presumptive laboratory evidence AND either clinical criteria OR epidemiologic evidence; or iii) meeting vital records criteria with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID19"" Other Comments Taiwan and New Zealand have stopped covid other countries have had it under control but need to watch for flare ups. Vietnam with a 97 million population did a very good job of controlling covid until a recent flare up as has Sri Lanka. New Jersey Data I found this data which shows what has happened to the death rate over the initial stages of covid-19 New Jersey Death Data 2015 to July 2020 The population of NJ has been stable at around 8.8 to 9 million. This data shows a big spike in death rates in April to 18,000 deaths per month up from a normal of about 6,000 then a return to 6,000 around June 2020 with July data showing around 5,500 deaths which is about 500 lower than in previous years - there may be data to update etc. It will be useful to see if there are lower death rates in the months ahead and if population of New Jersey remains stable. I wouldn't trust any numbers.  I believe we will find an over count.  Call your doctor for advice.  Buy one of those temp guns.  Or maybe a temp bracelet.  Start measuring yourself thru the day to get use to your daily/activity temperature variations. Medical sensor bracelets for multiple measurements are cheap now.  Under 100 bucks, and some even cheaper.  Some even download daily data for your doctor. I swear I saw one bracelet that did just about everything except a urine test. Monitor yourself at school.  You should be able to detect a temperature quicker than anyone.  Of course, other symptoms might precede a temp. What this most likely methods is that individuals who might have kicked the bucket later of a respiratory failure passed on of the coronary episode presently welcomed on by Coronavirus so it was delegated a Coronavirus prompted coronary episode (without testing for Coronavirus and so forth). In the event that this is right in future years we may see a fall in respiratory failure rates due to Coronavirus passings now and so forth - what does that truly mean ? It may mean that covid-19 has brought forward future deaths of people with other long term conditions Only future death rates will show this - ie - if we have overal lower death rates from all causes if death in future years than in previous years it will imply covid-19 brought forward future deaths Need to assess that state population stays materially constant as this will impact the result. So for NJ results indicate some return to normal death rates - or maybe a slight fall in monthly death rate after big spike up from av 6000 per month to 18000 deaths per month New Jersey Death Data 2015 to Sept  2020 It is possible certain catagories of death will rise - such as sucid. So the over all figures need to be reviewed by cause of death to provide meaning info otherwise important info will be missed What is Covid 19"

I remind you that the daily dose is not taken all at once, but several grams after each meal. The duration of treatment is two days. There are no side effects. First warning: Vitamin C must be made from natural raw materials, for example, the trademark SOLGAR (Swiss), WINDMILL (USA), etc. Second warning: Vitamin C should not be used for prophylaxis, but only for treatment. The use of vitamin C as a treatment for any kind of influenza was offered by a two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling. Don't discuss. Try and see. I won't argue with your treatment plan - that is your opinion. However, your requirement to have ""natural raw material"" vitamin C is not borne out by science. There is a side effect, oxalates will appear in the urine. This can lead to the formation of cameos in the kidneys. But the method is justified by the fact that vitamin C provokes apoptosis in cells affected by the virus. It is possible to reduce the effective dose of vitamin C. Some substances increase the sensitivity of cells to vitamin C. Is COVID-19 cured after taking Vitamin C & the symptoms appear after 2-14 days so is it better to do this treatment or visit the hospital? You can't call it a ""cure"". There is absolutely no evidence for this. However, if vitamin C were to help, it would be better to take it before symptoms develop. Take more if symptoms appear.

This probably explains why the infections are 100 times more in the USA than in India. The HVAC system circulates air and spreads the virus around and keeps it suspended in the air. The virus can infect through the eyes and maybe by breathing the air. The masks and all handwashing cannot prevent this.  The experts in the USA seem to have missed this and are barking up the wrong tree. In India, there are few indoor grocery stores which is an advantage. Think of it this way.  The virus has a nasty taste and smell when it enters the body.  And by a slight of hand or disguising trick, can enter and infect your body. It quickly multiplies.  It multiplies quicker than our body can respond with the right pattern.  Sorta like too many patients at the hospital at the same time. If we kill and preserve some of that dead virus, it will maintain that awful taste and smell.  Now the body has time to learn and make the supplies to fight it, because it has time and is not fighting an infection. The dead virus does not multiply.

This virus has specific times it can stay on specific surfaces. Plastic and stainless-steel are the most loved materials for it to stay on. Approx. 10-14 days, to say safe. They tested in laboratories so it stayed around 6-8 days in best conditions on these surfaces. Paper or ""wetness-sucking"" materials, under best conditions, it COULD stay around 3-5 days. IF it is on a surface, such as the INSIDE of your hand, then you can KILL it with disinfection liquids, such as Isopropy-alcohol, any type. And why did i highlight ""INSIDE"" of your hand? There is a clear answer on that. Same reasons why you won´t get stung by a ""stinging nettle herb"" I mean this vitico guy even said on his last message so yeah.... Something that is often misunderstood by people is the ""spreading by droplets through air etc.""... it even has gotten politicized.... a droplet in this case, can be as tiny as the measure of two H2O atoms and a virus in-between. Basically... then one can say this is the tiniest measure of a droplet. And even that this small is basically impossible, just a slightly bigger is, and you won´t even see it. If they say social-distancing 1-2m, does exactly nothing..... i have absolutely no idea where this came from or who agrees that this is a measure because literally it isn´t.... To be safe in that, one needs at least 4-6m.... and this is impossible. A virus is not live.  When we kill that is figuitive.   When it is destroyed with alcohol it is dissolved. It can no longer function.  It can not reproduce by itself.  It does not have a cell wall.  It has to invade a living cell to reproduce.  When that cell divides the virus is replicated.  That makes a copy of  the virus. It is not a living thing. I don't know about you,but I am thinking that if you could give yourself an electric  shock to your body maybe the virus would forget  it's a virus  ? There is no such thing as a living virus, so you can not kill something that is not alive"

Wow what a wonderful way to treat this! I will try to get the word out! Thank you so much. For Humanity! You do realize that vaping weed was probably what caused that ""gooey substance of semi solid-fluid consistency""? Vaping is extremely dangerous, and the vapors involved will destroy your lungs before COVID-19 gets to them. According to Healthline.org, 'Marijuana smokers tend to have more cough, mucus, and wheezing in comparison to people who don’t smoke."" I implore you not to try this, as it will kill you before the coronavirus can. Research from the American Lung Association says that vaping can cause bronchitis, mucus, and eventually COPD. ""Pot smoking doubles a person's risk of developing a regular hacking cough. It also triples the risk of coughing up phlegm and suffering from wheezy constricted breathing, researchers found."" """"You would worry about people being more susceptible to pneumonia, and of course, the end result of chronic bronchitis, if it persists long enough and is severe enough, is what we call COPD -- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"" Edelman said."" Credit to Please do not smoke weed to cure the coronavirus. It will not work.  The effects of vaping cause all of these ailments, and you do not want you lungs weakened when a respiratory disease is going around. PLease, please, please do not do this! You speak based on your assumptions, I guarntee you that you can save lives with this, as I had an attack of respiratory difficulties to the extent I was feeling sort of on the way to the line between life and death. In the moment of despair, I knew that I had some hashish my friend gave me for free a while ago. I did not use it as like I wrote before, I am not into that high personally on a daily basis. As I was feeling of great need, I assembled another highly improvised vaping depice out of another beaker as the one I made in the photos I gave to my friend for medicinal purposes as he has in general a chronic COPD condition. I vaped it and the first effect it has that in that moment of critical adrenalin respiratory difficulties it calmed my body down and helped me to breathe more normally. My body is still dealing with the new genetic code, but the vaping of marijuana has helped me a lot and who knows if I was someone with a very low immune system, this means life or death! This is SERIOUS! I would not write this here, if I was not 100% certain it can save peoples lives!!! Do you understand what great responsibility it means for someone to write a medical method without any clinical trials? Hence your concern, but I want to educate you that marijuana has been used as medicine for thousands of years and there are thousands of medical studies done on marijuana that point to it's medicinal properties and at times it has proven to actaully cure people of cancer, these are real stories of the real people that have the experience of being healed with this heavenly herb. The studies based on marijuana have led to the discovery of the endocannabinoid system that both THC and CBD have effect on. The stimulation of the marijuana molecules on the endocannabinoid system is probably the primary reason behind how it can help people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and also vaping marijuana is super healthy for the lungs based on the medical studies. I will bring the book with the references to the studies addressed in a later post to back up what I am saying with actual real medical studies. I am not making this up, I have discovered that vaping marijuana is super healthy for the lungs personally and especially now where I had the personal opportunity to test it myself on myself in the critical moment. For the time being, if you experience life and death respiratory situation, then vape decarboxylated marijuana, for it will help you and could save your life depending on how severe the symptoms. Some say not to do this? Say it to the man that is on his death bed and is powerless grasping for whatever help is at hand! Such a man if given to vape marijuana being told that it will help him, will receive help, for for that man it was a matter of life and death anyway and in the case it will kill him, it was at least worth a try as he was going to die anyway, but in the case it will save his life then who are you to educate on what is good or not for the human body? Like I said already, I am not a doctor of medicine, despite my first ambitions were to become a doctor and after several failed attempts to get into St George's Medical School, I eventually decided and realized that I would make a much better doctor as a chemist and as chemistry was my love since an early age, it was a  very natural transition. My friends the chemists from Poland are already in the process of a cure for cancer in the form of a complex of gold. During their studies they have discovered that all cancer cells had something in common, first they all were gold hungry, meaning they will eat gold as though it is food for them, secondly they all had a slightly acidic pH due to the process of lactic fermentation that allows the cell to manufacture it's own energy and therefore survive literally forever without oxygen. Based on these two concepts, they have created a complex of gold, perhaps octahedral in structure, with possibly 3 groups of CO2 and 3 groups of hypochlorite. I do not know the details of the structure, but I can assume the previously mentioned based on the mechanism of this complex. So, the gold complex, possibly introduced intravenously enters the blood. The complex passes by a cancer cell and is naturally absorbed by it. The gold complex has been designed so as to be stable at a pH >7, meaning not acidic. Now, when the complex enters the cancer cell, the complex is suddenly in an acidic environment. The even slight acidic conditions in the cancer cell cause the complex to fall apart, releasing the hypochlorite that begins to destroy the internal structures of the cell such as the various organelles and at the same time CO2 gas is released. Now every gas at a given temperature and pressure will occupy a certain volume, so the CO2 when it was part of the gold complex it was bound to it chemically by a dative-covalent bond and did not exist as separate molecules of CO2 gas in the atmosphere would behave. The moment a certain amount of the CO2 molecules is released, suddenly the gas molecules will expand to occupy the volume based on kinetics and literally blows up the cancer cell from within thereby destroying it's cell membrane, thereby exposing the contents to be dealth with and swept up by the immune system. As I was writing this, I had another episode with the respiration system, did the same thing straight away and it helps ALOT! Put it in simply, I have not tested this new medical method of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection on any other human being other than myself, I can safely say that it did not kill me, but it did bring great relief. Also garlic, hot chillies, ginger are very good medicinal foods as they boost the immune system and help to deal with both viral and bacterial infections. Please do not delete this post. It is really not right to deprive the world to judge for themselves about what can help mankind and what cannot. Please apply with care to those in most need. To be continued... I'm stuck at home so I'm just googling ideas for a coronavirus cure....I'm not trying to be a crackpot.  I'm just bored and thought a longshot is better than no shot.  So, I've read that some think a cytokine storm may be to blame for why some people have severe reactions to the coronavirus.  Then I've found that interleukins 1, 12, and 17 are thought to play an important role in cytokine storms.  When looking up why children don't seem to have severe reactions to the virus, I found that children often don't have as high of levels of IL-12 as adults.....so maybe IL-12 plays a big factor in determining how our body reacts to the virus.  Does anyone know of a IL-12 suppressor??  Preferably something easy for a lay person to get and doesn't have severe side effects.  Any thoughts would be welcome.  Again, I know it is a long shot, but it is a better way to spend my time than playing video games... I'm not saying the weed is the problem, I'm waiting for doctors and scientists to say for sure if THC and CBD and all that other stuff is good or bad. Vaping, on the other hand, ever since Juul came out, has been very well studied and it has been proven that vaping can create compounds that will ruin your lungs, which is the very last thing you want to happen in these times.

The first source for many is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. government's highest level of accurate information. Below is a direct link to an article dated June 11, 2020 from NIH's ""Management of COVID-19"" web site. It appears very informative and accurate even today. It also indicates various stages based on symptoms. Of course much of this involves advanced stages, which you apparently do not have, and may never develop. Information is your best help right now. The more you know about this, the more likely you can make the best decisions. Management of COVID-19 from NIH: The Mayo Clinic is considered one of the best in the world. You might wish to review these links and see if it offers any help. Much of it you will know, but there can always be some additional information that might help. The first is the basics on the disease and symptoms. Even if you think you know all this, read through this first before going to the next link : For more on what to do if you have contracted it, see the link below. Again, it will tell you things you know, but read it all anyway just to be sure you understand what it all means, and where to go from here. Note the part about ""Supportive care is aimed at relieving symptoms"" and things which can help. Staying hydrated is very important, as is good nutrition. Avoid any treatments that are not recommended by professionals. Hope this helps. and good luck to you all. Here is a dated but apparently accurate estimate of day-to-day variations for symptomatic people with COVID-19 based on reports from attending physicians. It comes from a fairly large number of patients in the early months of the infections in New York City. It appears that any nasty rebound that may occur will happen within 5-10 days after infection for older people. With younger patients, this rebound may go out to longer periods, and there is always a possible relapse to some extent for periods even longer than 14 days. This is worth a read because it covers many of the aspects of the initial phases of the disease, and The New York Times is a reasonably accurate source : I would definitely suggest putting the fact that none of you were tested at the very beginning, rather than towards the end. It also indicates various stages based on symptoms. Of course much of this involves advanced stages, which you apparently do not have, and may never develop.

But how did it hop to humans?,"A new study provides more clues to the virus' origins. ""However, some experts have criticized the study, saying it's unclear if coronaviruses can infect snakes.""  Snakes could still be a carrier even if they aren't infected. Yes but how would bats get the virus? I blame Batman he shouldn't have kissed that bat when The Joker dared him to. No, they couldn't. The carriers are still infected, i.e. the virus lives and reproduces in them. It is just not numerous enough to provoke symptoms. But coronaviruses can't live in cold-blooded animals at all. Moreover, the evidence in the ""snake"" paper is very weak itself. They do not compare the sequence of nCov with any actual snake virus. They just use similarity in codon usage bias in nCov and in two snake species as an argument. But same codon usage patterns can arise independently in different species. It is not a direct evidence. First it was snakes now it is bats. How about it was created in a laboratory. Scientists can do that you know and they can make new variations of Coronaviruses. That is like when they were saying AIDS came from monkeys when later it was found AIDS was created in a laboratory and spread through a"" new type"" of Hepatitis vaccine. The mainstream news won't tell you that though. Pushed right under the rug. Hi - first time I've posted here, I'm a science student from the UK & have been seeing the whole virus unfold via news,fake news etc - its hard seprating the truth to the resident evil beginnings sci fi also. Nobody says the truth so I will - not wanting to offend but countries like china have such a odd way of living, from the pollution of mass manufacture to the high end eatries - we know that resturants & supermarkets in china sell animal products to use & eat, I've seen vidoes of even leemas being eaten, bats with the stomaches open filled with food & the truth is they have eaten a speices which is a step too far & its going to bite us all if action isn't taken, I don't think this outbreak will become an epidemic but the next one might. Before everybody sdays racist, bigot etc, oh the young guy from england is a fool, I'm from a mixed race background myself & part of my background has french & poss spanish in it so that agruement won't wash. My view is liberal of science & life, being a young homosexual male has that effect. Another thing that has really annoyed me is the fact that - this is a possible epidemic - why WHY hasn't any government thought right lts a must quarentine everybody, stop all flights, all cargos & goods shipping out. I've seen various things about people still travelling to & from china, I saw a report yesterday that a news crew from the UK sent 50 odd staff to cover the story, they came back & did not quarentine themselves at all - I sent them an email asking about this & they refused to answer - what the hell I say it was the BBC & well all know thwey are as baised & dumb as it comes, this example of the stupidity of humans proves my theroey that we will wipe ourselevs out through just plain simple dumbness. Another story I saw from a london news site - a buisinessman came home from China & did not have time to read the articles therefore only qaurentines himself 3 days after coming home - thats enough time to spread a germ to 100's maybe 1'000s of people. One last theory - how do we know that this virus does not lay dorment - ie say a mobile phone made in china with somebody infected - its shipped & say I buy it 3 months down the line - is that infected??? This whole thing doesn't scare me - I just think its a eqauliser to todays mass over population of our planet & sad but worrying sign that the future is dark for many of us. OH one last thing - blaming bats snakes etc isn't cool, next we'll blame koalas for the aussie fires, I love bats - also its Valencia cfs embalem - one of my fav soccer clubs is tarnished now. Do you count as main stream news (""Rumors and Realities: Making Sense of HIV/AIDS Conspiracy Narratives and Contemporary Legends""), or a host of other science journals? Just a quick correction on the creation / spreading of the HIV virus theory.  The vaccine was for polio, there are some fascinating papers on this subject if your in for an interesting read. Welcome sohosaints! I think you have made some good points. Never be afraid to question everything and even what you have been taught. You seem very intelligent. Keep up on researching and keep an open mind. Sometimes what is actually really going on can be hard to believe. But I think you have made a good start in questioning things. That is interesting. I just remember reading a long time ago it was Hepatitis but you may be correct it may have been polio also. Maybe a bit of both depending in what area of the world or state. In order for a snake to be a carrier, they would need to be infected with the virus. A carrier by definition is an organism that is infected but does not show symptoms.  For example, (humans and all other organisms) are infected by many viruses that do not cause us to show any symptoms. We ""carry"" these viruses in us but they do not cause us to be sick. The Wuhan Coronavirus was created in a Lab in North Carolina - Lab-Made Coronavirus Triggers Debate The creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus has scientists discussing the risks of gain-of-function research. Nov 16, 2015: Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, last week (November 9, 2015) published a study on his team’s efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus, found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of to one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice, according to the team’s results, which were published in Nature Medicine. The results demonstrate the ability of the SHC014 surface protein to bind and infect human cells, validating concerns that this virus—or other coronaviruses found in bat species—may be capable of making the leap to people without first evolving in an intermediate host, Nature reported. They also reignite a debate about whether that information justifies the risk of such work, known as gain-of-function research. “If the [new] virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,” Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told Nature. In October 2013, the US government put a stop to all federal funding for gain-of-function studies, with particular concern rising about influenza, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). “NIH [National Institutes of Health] has funded such studies because they help define the fundamental nature of human-pathogen interactions, enable the assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents, and inform public health and preparedness efforts,” NIH Director Francis Collins said in a statement at the time. “These studies, however, also entail biosafety and biosecurity risks, which need to be understood better.” Baric’s study on the SHC014-chimeric coronavirus began before the moratorium was announced, and the NIH allowed it to proceed during a review process, which eventually led to the conclusion that the work did not fall under the new restrictions, Baric told Nature. But some researchers, like Wain-Hobson, disagree with that decision. The debate comes down to how informative the results are. “The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk,” Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence expert at Rutgers University, told Nature. But Baric and others argued the study’s importance. “[The results] move this virus from a candidate emerging pathogen to a clear and present danger,” Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance, which samples viruses from animals and people in emerging-diseases hotspots across the globe, told Nature. A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence Engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research Lab-made coronavirus related to SARS can infect human cells. Why use this inflammatory photo of a bat as clickbait for this otherwise informative article?  The quoted scientist clearly states that an as of yet undetermined intermediary animal must have passed the virus from bats to humans. He states this is because no bats were sold at the wildlife market in the epicenter of the outbreak. This photo gives bats an undeserved bad rap. that is  also my question and how did it get to snakes If you believe that I have a bridge in New York I’d like to sell you And, of course snakes eat bats On the plus side...maybe So-called Wet Markets will be shut down in China presumably airbourne spores - My mum is acting bizarrely - not only will she not go in a Chinese restaurant anymore or got to our favourite buffet restaurant (because there are Chinese chefs/waitresses there but wont let me have  a Chinese takeaway-because of the corona virus My money is on some guy cut a Bats throat...drank its blood...to be Better in Bed My idea is merely a recount of a ""fictional"" movie. Have you watched a movie named "" Contagion?""  Coincidentally the virus came from bat poop. The dropping fell on a chicken in an open-air kitchen,  where a cook was curing a chicken, the cook did not wash his hands with soap and water,  he merely wiped his hands on an apron,  he later shook a woman's hand, she became infected, and the rest is history, she became the carrier, she had sex with an old boyfriend, they all became carriers.  etc. etc. It is doubtful that this virus occurred naturally: ""unlikely to be fortuitous in nature"" means it's all but impossible that it mutated naturally and suggests this was created in a lab. I guess bats gave it to HIV-riddled snakes who then passed it onto Pangolins. *shrugs* Just thought this should be mentioned. Well I’m no scientist I’m just an average person but sometimes common sense has the answer I am not sure of all that was sold on the market but as far as how the jump was made it can be as simple as a mosquito bite of the carrier to the new host that being the case and the question of it being most likely a warm blooded issue it would have had to have bitten a bat then a human or a bat then say for instance a pig of a cow that was sold on the market that had infected the meat then passed to humans that way but in either case all things sold on that market should be tested for the virus or its mutations if it can be traced from say bats like human mad cow disease can be can be contracted from eating meat from a infected cow with the disease in t is possible the bat bit a animal if that is where it come from but I don’t know I think it could be from mice or rats transferring it via mosquito to bat to something else or to human I mean come on the Black Plague come from mice seems like most things disease wise seem to come from mice  but meh I’m just a average person throwing out a very wild guess  but sometimes over thinking a issue complicates a problem more than it should be when the answer is really a simple one you didn’t see because the answer was there all along it wasn’t really thought of to begin with but I’m sure it’s already been thought of Kattria"

So tell me what sense does a vaccine that has a prevention rate that is lower than the recovery rate of the disease? 1000 people get covid 996 recover 4 die what if those 4 had the vaccine ? If those 4 recovered  then great but how do we know who they are? There is also the growing issue pf long  covid Your math is only partly correct because the CDC has already said that only 10,000 people have died from covid, the others died with covid.   Also 7700 people die every day in the USA before covid.  Now if you can find the adjusted total death totals in the USA that reflect the total daily death total per day this would show how many more people are actually dying because of this disease.  However you will not find these numbers because they reveal exactly how many people are actually dying of covid. Simplified in 2017 Americans died of all causes.  Note this does not reflect covid deaths at all because covid was not here.  What we need to determine exactly how many Americans died of covid is to see how many more died in 2020 from all causes.  When this number is made public we will know the exact death rate which I predict will be trivial. PS Over 1300 people die in the USA every day from the effects of tobacco.  So why is it legal for 500,000 Americans to die every year from tobacco Excess deaths over say a 5 year average are the best numbers to go by I would use 50 years and turn the actual death rate into a percent as the population is a variable.  However 5 to 10 years would be most rational.  I am glad that you seem to agree, and what you will find is that this number will be hidden or determined to be irrelevant when we know that mathematics is the great equalizer 50 years is way too far back Think of advances in modern meds The last 5 or poss 10 years is more accurate If you have the 50 years though you can see developing trends, you could also use any combination of years, such as all 50, 1, 2, 3 ,4,5,10,20 ect   These stats could also be used to show those trends.   Also the Pfizer vaccine by Pfizer's own admission is not said to prevent the disease, they claim that it prevents symptoms in 90 percent of patients.  Rather strange when 85 percent of people, at a minimum already have no symptoms.  So perhaps the vaccine is preventing symptoms in 5 percent of people max?  They will not claim it to be a cure because after widespread administration people will still die, so they can not expose themselves to that liability I agree that tobacco is horrible for you, but if we made it illegal there would be a Prohibition-era illegal trade that continues. People who are addicted will break the law to get tobacco, and all such a law would do would inflate the prison population. Thankfully, smoking has been less and less prevalent, so over the years the last people who still smoke will naturally be removed from the population. So you do not care about the 500,000 Americans that die from tobacco every year.  LOL you probably want heroin legalized too because this would end the illegal trade. Yawn Where did Pfizer make this admission, and where is the 85% figure taken from? Common knowledge if you look. The ‘90% effective’ measure means that the vaccine prevented symptoms of Covid-19 in 90% of volunteers who received the vaccine compared to the placebo. And it's actually 86 percent that have no covid symptoms But but but CNN said Any more questions? Taken from that article: ""We also do not know whether the Pfizer vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease - or even whether it only prevents symptoms of infection, rather than infection itself. "" If the vaccine works as intended, (as early trial data indicated) there should be a strong neutralising antibody response, that would stop infection. I do not see Pfizer admitting that the vaccine will not prevent infection? To your other point about asymptomatic infection rate, a recent article in Nature reported that the true rate of asymptomatic infection may have been overestimated and is closer to 20% based on a meta-analysis of multiple studies: Would you buy a car if the salesman said. If the car works as intended you will be able to drive it home?  Would you trust your life to that car? The fact is that Fauci admitted that these vaccines will only prevent symptoms and not the disease.  LOL I would actually like an explanation as to how that process happens in the first place? No wait I know, as 86 percent at least already have no symptoms and 99.6 percent who do catch covid recover anyway. LOL but but but CNN said Youre assuming that the vaccine will not prevent infection absent any statement to that effect, when it seems more likely that it does given the low occurrence of symptoms in the pool of vaccinated trial participants -and also considering that it induced a strong neutralising antibody response in the early phase trial. The Fauci link you provided doesnt 'admit these vaccines will only prevent symptoms and not the disease'. In fact he said [and note the date]: ""The primary thing you want to do is that if people get infected, prevent them from getting sick, and if you prevent them from getting sick, you will ultimately prevent them from getting seriously ill,' Fauci said at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit. ' , and all of my colleagues would settle for, is the primary endpoint to prevent clinically recognizable disease.' "" An effective vaccine should do both as the body's vaccine-primed antibody response to virus detection will be neutralisation such that the virus cannot infect cells and start replication and onward transmission. I am not assuming anything as I know nothing about the vaccine to assume.  I merely reported what Pfizer claimed, something that makes no sense in the first place. I do know that no flu vaccine has ever prevented the current strain of the flu, and I also know that the people who get the flu vaccine get the flu at a higher percentage than those who do not. Are you also aware that people who got the flu vaccine are 36 percent more likely to get covid-19? No you had no clue did you? But but but, you can believe whatever you hear and see on TV.  I do not The flu vaccine is not the one being considered, but your referencing it is telling of what i assume to be an ideological/political perspective on the vaccine (maybe all vaccines). Most of your claims thus far have been shown to be inaccurate, and the above post contains further falsehoods on the flu vaccine, that I do not care to discredit. Ultimately no-one is forcing you to take the vaccine so just dont take it i guess. The flu vaccine is totally relevant because people who were gullible enough to get the flu vaccine are 36 percent more likely to get covid-19.  This is a fact, so what diseases will the people who get the covid-19 vaccine get or get at a higher rate.  Furthermore Pfizer is not saying that their vaccine will prevent the disease but merely prevent symptoms. LOL, look get on line and get shot up.  Are you aware that vaccines cause billions of dollars of damage and that their is a special vaccine court set not to pay victims but to hide the injuries that vaccines cause from the general public Russia claims 95% effective vaccine with Sputnik V (1). This one is also based on a viral vector like the Oxford vaccine, and is also more stable than the mRNA viruses. Assuming this is a safe product, it adds more to the bag of vaccines to stop the spread of the virus, and prevent further mutations. Preventing further mutation is essential to preventing more lethal strains from developing, and/or prevent the current one from evading immunity due to mutation. It does not matter if the immunity is from an infection or the vaccine. The virus, left to spread, will eventually evade all immunity, and return in some form. We don't want to find out what form that might be. For those wondering about the value of a vaccine: The virus is lethal to many people. The vaccine is not.  It will prevent fatal infections. Whatever numbers you wish to quote, there is no doubt that a near-zero death rate from the vaccine is better than the considerable rate we are suffering without it. This is not even a close call. 1. 86 percent of those infected with covid have no symptoms so they do not suffer.  99.6 percent of those with covid make a full recovery.  I had covid and I had mild symptoms.  Pfizer also does not claim that their vaccine prevents covid, they claim that it prevents symptoms though you may still get sick Useless, why would I get vaccinated for a disease that I and my entire family already had? The Prohibition issue is not that a deletorius substance should be made illegal but is a persons freewill being trampled - or in more Politically Correct terms - a persons right to choose has been violated.  It is difficult to legislate against stupidity - better to be sure people are informed of facts surrounding substances effects, uses and possibility of addiction.   Heroin, meth, etc are substances that endanger one's life with even a single use, let alone contamination by dealers so should remain illegal or at the very least strictly controlled.   Side note, many substances, including tobacco and alcohol, have medicinal uses - and as with any medication its side effects and possibilities for injury must be weighed against advantageous effects.   Making something illegal makes it impossible for physicians to legally prescribe it.   As in the marijuana usage."

They do however have a very effect way of dealing with these pathogens and that is the heat/fever generated by the high metabolic rates required by a mammal to fly* (Ref below: Bats carry many viruses so why don’t they get sick).  But what happens to them when you put them into a cage and keep them in a cold Wuhan Market?  They get very sick and contagious because they have been robbed of the one thing that they have always used to cure themselves, the heat/fever of flight. Now enter humans into the equation, similarly children and young adults have strong core body temperatures, very high metabolic rates and can easily generate heat/fever enough to fight viral pathogens very similar to a bat that is free to fly.  Take away that strong core body temperature, high metabolism and ability to generate heat/fever with age, inactivity, sickness and misguided treatments and you have exactly the same conditions of that of a bat in a cage.  Sedentary seniors, diabetics, ventilator patients and people taking fever reducing medications, ALL have one thing in common, they all have reduced metabolic abilities to maintain strong body temperatures and/or they have impaired their ability to produce enough heat/fever to cure themselves and they are dying by the hundreds of thousands.  If a bat can cure COVID-19 with a Hyperthermic Treatment of Flight, surely we should at least be giving heat/fever a try to treat humans.  Just how difficult is it to warm up hypothermic patients, turn up the heat on ventilators and STOP giving them fever reducing medications, and as for the bats, just let them out of the cages. * I dont think it is considered likely that the spillover to humans occurred in the Wuhan seafood market, or that the bats that carried the predecessor virus to sars-cov-2 were held in cages at the market. First off cages are the only way you can keep wild live bats at a market and it was actually mentioned that they were stacked one on top of one another.  Many researchers still believe that the markets were the most likely point of infections to humans.  The final clue that supports this theory 100% is the exact similarity that is now happening on mink farms across the northern hemisphere.  Caged mink are being kept in cold conditions to promote fur growth and are in fact hypothermic because of their inability to produce heat through metabolism.  Both mink and farm workers are being infected with COVID-19.  Yes you might question either case individually but together, they are very credible evidence. Theres no doubt that high intensity farming provides optimal conditions for virus outbreaks, especially where the animals are highly suited to the particular virus as were the minks. My point is more that I dont think that the particular sars-cov-2 predecessor virus carrying bats were in the Wuhan market at all. It seems more likely that the pandemic virus was brought into the market by a human and that the market was just a suitable location for it to spread quickly amongst the market-goers. There is still a distinct possibility that the captured bats where already infected with the coronavirus that has been found in their caves, but were unable to cure themselves because of the cages and lack of flight.  By the time they got to the market they were sick and very contagious and infected the people around them, to me that is the simplest explanation and the most likely. Its not certain that the type of bats that would be the most likely to carry a related coronavirus were even sold in the Wuhan market; certainly, they are not native to that region of China. Another reason I doubt this narrative is that the earliest recorded case had no connection to the wet market, which further suggests that the virus was introduced into humans elsewhere. There is also the evidence of captured pangolins infected in March 2019 in Guangdong with a virus with high sequence match in the RBD to sars-cov-2, likely transmitted to them from their human captors. This also suggests a spillover from bats had already occurred by at least this date and much earlier than the Wuhan outbreak. There has been no direct link to the source of this virus. Many believe it arose in bats, and jumped to humans. This is a distinct possibility. But it may not have happened recently. Francis Collins, the director of N.I.H., suggests that the virus may have evolved in humans over many years before reaching its current state (1). Quoting from (1): ""The researchers analysed genomic data available from SARS-CoV-2 and other similar coronaviruses, showing that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) sections of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins were so effective at binding to human cells, they had to be caused by natural selection."" and quoting directly from Collins from (1) : ""The second scenario is that the new coronavirus crossed from animals into humans before it became capable of causing human disease,"" director of the National Institute of Health, Francis Collins explains on the NIH blog. ""Then, as a result of gradual evolutionary changes over years or perhaps decades, the virus eventually gained the ability to spread from human-to-human and cause serious, often life-threatening disease."" end quote Unless a clear source is found in animals, this seems the most likely scenario. That is because the affinity of the viral spike protein for the human ACE2 protein is in the nanomolar range. This is very tight binding and is the reason why this virus is so infective in humans. ""The COVID-19 Virus May Have Been in Humans For Years, Study Suggests"" 1. I think I am now starting to understand why there are almost 70 million COVID-19 cases and over 1.5 million deaths around the world, almost the entire focus and direction of research is absolutely and singularly in one direction ONLY and NOBODY should be suggesting a different route no matter how many are in fact dead.  I want to ask just how that is working out for them but I think the numbers speak for themselves."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/masks-for-coronavirus-but-not-flu.3085/,Masks for Coronavirus but not flu?,"First,  let me say that I am not trying to start a debate; I am simply seeking information and trying to understand. The CDC does not recommend the use of masks for influenza, which is also primarily spread by droplets.   Why the difference? What is different about the Coronavirus that masks help slow its transmission when they don't slow the transmission of influenza? One assumes there must some physical difference in the virus or in how it is spread? Thank you in advance for any information you can provide. Coronavirus is more dangerous, we don't know enough about it, and there is no vaccine. Also, Coronavirus can be airborne, not just in droplets. Any benefit to wearing a mask to stop the spread of coronavirus should also apply to influenza because the respiratory transmission dynamics are similar. Its likely that CDC advice is different due to emergency nature of pandemic and the effort to curb the spread as much as possible. I remember extensive news covereage, but ok. Here in the UK our influenza and pneumonia deaths are now higher than covid deaths yet nobody is bothered about that Do you want Annual or monthly flu deaths? Current deaths rates which responses should be based on Your evidence/ source on this would have been helpful but influenze is a known illness... It pretty much hospitalises the same number of patients every year with a similar peak every year and the NHS (in the UK) are well prepared and know how to plan for this. We have no idea how many people would be hospitalised with COVID19 in the same period. The NHS has struggled every year with influenza but got through it.... I would feel uncomfortable if the message from the NHS was 'lets see what happens and if number increase dramatically then... good luck folks!' Source is the ONS data graph = super reliable Note 5 states 'A death can be registered with both COVID-19 and Influenza and Pneumonia mentioned on the death certificate. Because pneumonia may be a consequence of COVID-19, deaths where both were mentioned have been counted only in the COVID-19 category.' so I do not think it is a reliable source for the claim made. There are about 80 studies on PubMed showing that viruses are too small and go right through masks. Evidently CDC hasn't read these. Best way to protect yourself is to boost your immune system & when you cough cover your mouth. When you're sick, stay home. Anything other than an N95 mask can't block the virus itself, its the droplets that have it that need to be blocked. Partial blocking is better than nothing Collecting and growing a petri dish of virus and bacteria in front of your nose and mouth is a bad idea. The mask is bathed in warm moist air.  The vehicle for these repeated flare ups is not known.  It's probably the masks that is spreading this stuff.   HEY....it's 2020. That's why you get a new one or wash it? How to call and feed a virus.  A moist scaffold....close to body temp.  One would need a clean mask every 30 minutes. Are you rubbing your mask on your friends mouths? Also I belive that would be Ideal for bacteria. Doesn't SARS-COV-2 thrive on hard surfaces? Anyway, it is suposed to get trapped behind your mask, and you take your mask and throw it out or wash it, without touching it to other surfaces to spead your germs. If you got virus behind your mask, It's yours. There is ample scientific evidence that masks reduce the spread of this virus (1, 2), and would reduce the spread of flu and cold viruses if people wore them during those seasons as well.  This is not open to debate. It is scientific reality at its finest - directly helping people!  The hard data is in on masks. They absolutely help. There can be  no doubt. All infectious respiratory agents are spread by exhaled aerosols and droplets from the carrier to the unsuspecting target. This issue about the value of masks seems to be a no-brainer, but that designation may have different meanings for this situation..... Rest assured there is no doubt that the use of face masks, properly made and worn properly, can be very significant in reducing infectivity by minimizing spread of COVID-19. Wear a mask - it protects everyone. To be sure, the life you might save by wearing a mask could be your own! 1. 2. Unless you breathe 100% virus with every breath and they are able to survive without water [droplets] then yes there is an issue. If however you are a normal human being, the moisture which contains the virus is far larger. The best way to protect yourself is actually to not regularly go to public places where you would be unable to social distance."

A few million might die, and millions more damaged for life. Is it worth it for America?!","There are recent reports in the news of an increasing interest in simply allowing the COVID-19 disease to run its course, unfettered from now on, while trying to protect the most susceptible people from catching it (if they have not already). Current efforts by some, inadvertent or intentional, tend to suggest that this is playing out right now. The impact of such a policy is much less costly to the economy, etc.  which, some think, would rid us of the virus so that the survivors can ""move on"". This approach is known as Herd Immunity (1). There are several reasons why this may not be a good idea. It will certainly result in many additional fatalities and morbidities, and by at least an order of magnitude.  Most Americans likely would not find this acceptable.  However. despite being In the majority, they currently have no means to alter the course of decisions, whoever is making them. Unfettered spread of the virus may also increases the possibility for more infective and lethal strains to develop (2). We must recall that the original SARs and the related MERS viruses had 10% and 30% fatality rates, respectively. The greater the spread of the pandemic, the larger the number of viral replications and resultant mutations, any one of which may make the virus more infective, and/or more lethal. It could also work the other way around, perhaps resulting in a less lethal strain developing, and being less infective. It is unknown what mutations will arise in the future, but those advocating Herd Immunity are hoping that it will become less infective and less lethal. To most experts in medicine, ""hope"" is not a sound strategy for dealing with a lethal, infectious disease of as yet unknown ""capabilities"". As of mid-July, a careful analysis (2) of existing data indicates that at least 65% of people would need to be infected (and likely higher) to attain Herd Immunity. Fatalities would reach over 2 million, with millions more suffering life-long morbidity - debilitating conditions from stroke, heart and vascular damage, kidney damage, etc. The number of mutations would be vastly higher if it were allowed to infect and replicate freely. A direct quote from (2) summing things up regarding unfettered replication of this virus is below. Keep in mind that these results are from a pandemic largely contained at this time. ""More than 8000 observed single mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes have raised serious concerns about changes in infectivity. Qualitatively, such infectivity is proportional to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) and host ACE2 receptor. This work proposes a machine learning model to evaluate the relative infectivity following the mutations. We show that five out of six SARS-CoV-2 substrains have become more infectious, while the other one becomes less infectious. We found that a few potential future mutations on the S protein could lead to more dangerous new viruses."" end quote Should the country continue trying to minimize the pandemic, treating it as a serious current and future threat, or simply let it run its course, hoping that things just get better? (1) ""Mutations Strengthened SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity"" (Michigan State University) (2) That is not happening in the UK Here we have increasing infection rates and reducing deaths & hospitalisations Basing responses on infection rates is subjective as we never know the exact numbers Basing responses on hospitalisations and deaths is objective as we know those exact numbers Right now the UK would be better all round investing in herd immunity so that once done those vulnerable would be safer to venture out The most recent data indicate that notions of herd immunity has worked out well in Great Britain, or in Sweden,  the latter which actively pursued it (1). Here is a quote from (1), dated September 1, 2020 : ""....the U.K. has a fatality rate of 12.5%, second only to Italy’s 13.4%. Sweden has a fatality rate of 6.9%. To put those figures in context, the U.S. has had 55.57 COVID-related deaths per 100,000 people and a fatality rate of 3.1%, less than half the rate of Sweden."" End quote These figures do not take into account the morbidity data. Not exactly what some would say is working out well for GB. The same is true of Sweden.  The lower numbers in the U.S. compared to some European countries is due more to limiting the pandemic in many states. It is likely that attempting herd immunity, which is being considered by some in the U.S. (2), will not turn out well either. Title (1): (1) For more on the issue in the U.S. : (2) Where is that UK mortality rate from - all the past data or just the recent data? The article does not say. Since you are asking this question, it seems you have not read the article. There is much more to it than the quote in post # 3. Please try reading the article. It is very informative about the problems of attempting herd immunity, especially with this virus. The article and the data it uses is pointless if it does not embrace the current situation relevant to each country UK has rising infections yet has lowering deaths and hospitalisations The issue of the thread is the results of attempting herd immunity, which was the case until late March in the U.K. It is significant to point out that the U.K. government instituted stronger measures in late March after it was clear that the quest for herd immunity would not be reasonable. What is happening now results from abandoning the concept, and mandating approaches at limiting infections, as opposed to maximizing them. It is NOT a result of herd immunity. If it was, there would not be rising infections. Quoting from (1) in the above post: ""The U.K. introduced lockdown measures on March 23, and on March 25, the same day that Britain’s Prince Charles tested positive for the coronavirus, the U.K. government said police would be given the power to use “reasonable force” to enforce shelter-in-place rules."" end quote GB's current statistics is not a result of herd immunity, but by active measures to prevent viral spread. Herd immunity was clearly abandoned, and when it was, the situation improved. This appears to be happening in many countries as measures to mitigate the impact has reduced serious cases, likely due to masks and social distancing. The severity of the disease now appears linked to the amount of virions an individual is exposed to.  The mitigation efforts would therefore limit the severity of the disease, but not necessarily the number of new infections. From what the experts are saying in the uk social distancing and face masks are not now the reason with the reason being that the virus has already done its worse for the greater majority leaving the most vulnerable still at high risk Hence the rising infection rates and reducing deaths etc This postulate, that ""the greater majority"" have already been infected, and do not significantly add to the numbers, is highly unlikely. If indeed the ""virus has already done its worse for the greater majority"",  you should be seeing rising infections. They should be declining, since you are suggesting that over 50% of the country has been infected (i.e. ""greater majority'). Please provide a reference to this claim. By doing its worst for the greater majority I should have made that clearer - for the greater majority of the most vulnerable not the greater majority of all Ive thought for a while that political leadership in certain countries have quietly accepted a herd immunity strategy in pursuit of economic recovery (without making such explicit). To the main point raised, mutation is something ive been concerned about myself. The Sars outbreak of 2003-04 was largely fuelled by a functional mutation that caused a more pathogenic strain to emerge. With Sars-cov-2, a probable more transmissible version emerged around the end of February and quickly became the dominant variant around the world. Despite this, researchers have noted that the virus is relatively genetically stable and has a much slower mutation rate compared with influenza, for example, and indeed the virus seems to be very well adapted to human transmission already which might suggest that there is little pressure to evolve. Coronaviruses are however noted for their ability to recombine when a host is infected with more than one strain at the same time. The longer the pandemic state continues, and especially if left to spread unfettered, increases the instance of this occuring, particularly now that we are observing confirmed sporadic reinfections around the world, and considering the reports of high spread in farmed minks in Europe and US, where mink-to-human infection was also confirmed. There was a post on Virological.org in June that postulated that Sars-cov-2 is able to recombine with Mers, with the author noting the potentially 'apocalyptic' scenario were such to occur. The WHO reported a handful of Mers cases in Saudi Arabia in April through May of this year. While still theoretical, it is one reason for caution in espousing that the virus just be allowed to spread through populations. infection rates are subjective hospital admissions and death rates are objective So why are most countries using infection rates to instigate responses? There is little to debate in your excellent post, PseudaFed. Recombination between strains of the same virus is sometimes known as ""antigenic shift*"". While this refers primarily to the surface antigens, it relates to aspects of a virus's pathogenicity and its infectivity since the immune system does not recognize the new strain as it might either of the original strains. Since there are so many coronavirus strains circulating, and its ability to infect various species other than man (recent reports add deer mice) indicate one means by which a more lethal strain could develop should the pandemic run out of control. The sooner it is stopped, the less likely such strains can emerge. This recombination is most well known in influenza.  A quote from the below link : ""Some strains of avian influenza (from which all other strains of influenza A are believed to stem), can infect pigs or other mammalian hosts. When two different strains of influenza infect the same cell simultaneously, their protein capsids and lipid envelopes are removed, exposing their RNA, which is then transcribed to mRNA. The host cell then forms new viruses that combine their antigens; for example, H3N2 and H5N1 can form H5N2 this way. Because the human immune system has difficulty recognizing the new influenza strain, it may be highly dangerous, and result in a new pandemic."" end quote Had not heard about MERs re-emerging. That certainly is not a good thing.  There are simply too many unknowns to allow this virus uncontrolled spread among people (and animals), all the while ""hoping"" for the best. One suspects also that while it is likely that ""there is little pressure to evolve"" transmissiblity, the lethal nature of mutations is much harder to predict since it seems more likely a matter of chance rather than gaining any advantage.  As you no doubt are aware, it is not advantagous for a pathogen to kill its host. You are quite correct in believing that a more lethal strain could readily develop given the opportunity, especially when various host species are in the mix of things, and all the strains they may be carrying or later exposed to. The unique features of this virus, such as a high rate of asymptomatic infections makes it a greater threat for more lethal strains emerging from recombination, or by mutations in the existing strain (known as antigenic drift**) * ** The speed and accuracy of data has only increased the confusion of it's context.  Lack of or delay of data might have been the pass generations secret to survival.   The knowledge is killing us. Many would say it is the lack of knowledge that is killing us. And knowledge is defined, in part, as being accurate regarding its content. That is why accurate and rapid testing results are critical to isolating those infected, contact tracing and minimizing spread.  But you are certainly correct in noting ""the speed and accuracy of data has only increased the confusion"". There can be no doubt of this, and it must be remedied ASAP. And ""past generations"" is a relative term. Before vaccinations, many did not survive. Check out the mortality rate of past generations for things like small pox and bubonic plague. The Black Death (bubonic plague) claimed as many as 50 - 60% of Europeans back in the 14th century. Knowledge of fleas and rats would have eliminated the problem, but they knew nothing of it at the time.  This lack of knowledge killed millions of them. What a pleasure to read debates and discussion in fact with references as opposed to the posts I relentlessly used to try and debunk on Yah00 in a mire of ignorance and conspiracy theories, so thank you in the forst instance. I ahve used this site for a long time for information and interest and although a lot is beyind my understanding, it is in the main understandable and I learn new information to challenge my understanding on a subject to move forward. Enough of the personal waffle, and to argue against Governments attempting herd immunity - How could Governments gain an advantage for letting any virus run rampant in a population based on: 1) Resources to allow day-to-day practices of helping walk-in injured would be massively strained to the point that an elderly patiet having fallen at home would be less likely to survive visiting a hospital for treatment as opposed to being treated by family a home. 2) Denying a population taking expected healthcare assistance would play straight into the opposition parties (I admit this is more my perspective of the UK). You need to keep the majority of a population on your side to continue your direction of a nation. 3) Again more my UK perspective but the most vulnerable people to the virus are typically the demographic that vote for the current Government; if anything the UK want to protect the older/ 40-60 generations short-term. I am not convinced on the virus mutating to become more lethal but likewise with the virus population how would you realistically understand if that is true? Mutations have been identified but how much of a population is required to understand it's true fatality rate now without losing control and merely reporting out. If anything my concerns on mutation woud be the potential impact long-term on a patient and how it would impact in later life. I guess I will read more than comment and to reiterate, a pleasure to read structured debates albeit at times a little beyond me. Regards Actually there is a very real chance of the virus becoming more lethal. A classic example is the polio vaccine, which is typically an attenuated poliovirus (altered but still a virus). It could, under certain circumstances mutate and revert to the paralyzing wild-type strain. Below is a quote from *: ""Oral polio vaccine ""After wild poliovirus type 2 was declared eradicated in 2015, the world switched from trivalent to bivalent OPV (bOPV). Trivalent OPV contains all three types of poliovirus, while bOPV only contains poliovirus type 1 and 3. This switch means that OPV no longer protects against WPV2. Very rarely, when there is insufficient coverage in a community the vaccine-virus may be able to circulate, mutate and, over the course of 12 to 18 months, and cause paralysis. This is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus."" end quote. There are a number of ways that the coronavirus can become more lethal. Keep in mind that its cousins, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, two very closely related viruses, have 10-30-% mortality rate. There is no way of knowing where this virus is going. Because it has close relative that are much more lethal, the only rational course of action is to try to minimize its spread. By limiting its replication, you reduce its ability to mutate. * Corona has done more weird-ass **** in nine months than perhaps anything in known history. And people want to court it. But, wait! Herd Immunity mean....WE SHOULD LET 'EM.  However, most of you share some bump of ulgies with'em, so...... And.....Economy........yeah, Resource-based Economy. Ending Transaction - for all our sakes.  Cos ya all can't not buy nothin..... Is that a triple negative? Yes, they  ""share some bump of ulgies with'em"". Sadly, we cannot limit the infection to the pro-herd folks. Herd immunity does indeed seem to be the only answer to this pandemic.  It is exactly the same solution that caused the end to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and after a 100 years there seems to be no better solution today. A vaccine will not always work, and if it does work for some it might not work for others. Also, it might cause more problems than it solves; resulting in stronger, more virulent, more adaptable versions of the virus.  Lockdown has helped hugely in slowing the pace of the spread of this virus and also in allowing people to gain immunity at an acceptable rate. Hopefully, as the exposure to the virus is slowly implemented it will have less and less effect on people, till eventually it dies out. A vaccine is not the solution, just look at AIDS; it has been around for almost half a century without a working vaccine being developed. Small Pox, polio, measles, rubella, and chicken pox to name just a few have been eradicated by vaccines. They have no comparison to HIV, nor does this one. While immunity may not be as lasting, no one can know for sure. And yes, it could make matters worse. Only time will tell. No one has a crystal ball on this one. True. What I meant to say is that if it were going to go away naturally,nopoint in trying artificial solutions which might just exacerbate the situation. Firstly, it is not likely to go away permanently.  The more it circulates and mutates, the less likely that will ever happen.  It is a retrovirus and they have a nasty habit of hanging around endlessly. And mutating. No one can know where this virus is going, but the experts want to stop it fast, and for very good reasons. Which is why the whole world is trying to develop vaccines. It seems unlikely they are doing this for ""no point"". I agree with most of what you say. Look at it this way,every country is trying to produce a corona vaccine. In fact in many countries several labs will be vying to get their vaccines out first.  What this means is hundreds? Maybe more vaccines each different from the other. The world recovered from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, without a cure for it ever being found. A few years later the whole episode seemed to have been erased from the human mind. There was very little information about the 1918 pandemic in the public domain. Which solution is better? Take my own experience so far. Ten close friends and relations (different cities) caught the corona virus , nine of them recovered and are none the worse for wear. One  died but he was well into his seventies and so is an anomalous case. If you want my advice for what it is worth. It is this: continue to wear masks; continue social distancing; continue to sanitise. Till this pandemic is over the hill and done with. Festina lente: "" Make haste slowly."""
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/is-it-possible-i-had-the-coronavirus-in-january.1313/,Is it possible I had the coronavirus in January?,"I had a very strange illness in January. There was no runny nose or head cold, just a dry cough, fatigue, a bit of a headache, and a fever of about 101°,  which was very strange because I practically never get a fever when I get sick (my temp is usually under 98°). I was sure I was in for long bout with whatever it was, but the fever went down by the third day, and after about four days of doing nothing but sleeping, drinking plenty of water, and playing video games, I started to feel much better. The cough lingered a bit, but that's usual for me after any illness that gets into my lungs. I thought this was very strange because when I get sick the illness usually lasts at least 7 to 10 days, and a flu lasts two weeks, but this, whatever it was, seemed to be mostly gone by the fifth day. It was the shortest ""cold"" I'd ever had, which was fortunate because I had an operation scheduled for three days after that (and yes, I told them about the ""chest cold,"" but they said it didn't matter). Is it possible I had the coronavirus? I know the first cases in China were recorded in December and this was the third week in January, so it's possible, but this was in Alabama which didn't have any confirmed cases until today (mid-March) and I hadn't traveled recently. No one here would be able to make any sort of definitive statements in regards to your situation at that time. It would all be based on pure speculation and that's not really beneficial to you. January 9 at my endocrinologist appointment I pointed out my glands were swollen. He ignored me and examined my thyroid gland. Days after my appt. I was sick for about 2 months and I have a diagnosed autoimmune condition that I have all my life. My body constantly fights infections that do not have to actually exist. First I was Flu like and had a fever, the fever disappeared after a day or two. Then I had trouble breathing that resembled asthma. I purchased a Flonase inhaler and used it regularly and then purchased a second inhaler after using it up. But the inhaler was not good enough. So, I used 2 different the Flonase and a Benzedrine inhaler together daily for weeks. But I continued to have one gland that was sore and swollen until about a week ago. I read that the Chinese were asking for Roche's Interleukin-6 inhibitor. So, I googled Resveatrol IL-6 and discovered that Resveatrol is a potent IL-6 inhibitor. So, I started supplementing on 500 to 1,000 Milligrams of Res last week. My swelled painful gland went away after a couple days. Now, I feel healthy taking my usual Graves medications plus 500 Milligrams of 98% Resveratrol. I do not have a clue of my illness since I was not tested and I think I might have had a Flu. Is there a way to be tested for Corona if you feel healthy?  My timing was when the Corona stated and I have a documented underlying medical condition might make my body fight off certain types infections. The rules surrounding testing are rapidly changing. If you're looking for the most up to date information covering testing and whether you can be tested, the CDC suggests you contact your State Health Department - / - Hi Eric, I wonder the same thing. I’m a registered nurse currently working in a public hospital in South Australia. Around Dec 3rd we had a cluster of five or six staff come down with severe flu like illness after caring for a patient who had respiratory symptoms. My colleagues were typically off sick for about two weeks and they all tested negative for flu. In addition one I know had raised WCC and CRP, and I believe one or two persisted to pneumonia. They all had a terrible dry persistent cough that continued long after fever, shortness of breath and runny nose had resolved. Then in the following weeks several other staff members came down with the same mystery illness....including myself on Christmas Day. We all agree we’ve never had anything like it, and the cough was very bad. Personally I felt like I’d fractured my sternum the pain was so intense. As far as I’m aware nobody tested positive for any known flu and many were told they must have another virus. I guess without a serology test to check for antibodies, we’ll never know, but would be interested in the opinion of anyone ID related. Incidentally the patient, from a facility tested positive for an influenza... think A from memory... and was then isolated and barrier nursed. While it would be unlikely she had travelled overseas, I’m sure it’s very feasible one of her carers may have. Thanks in advance for any opinions. Cheers Hi Tory, So, The Coronavirus has been floating around for a long time before the Chinese New Year. Have you tried the Resveratrol 98% supplement? As there are studies that indicate it is an IL-6 inhibitor. This could used to help prevent Cytokines or Cytokine Storms. I had a blood tests panel during my flu like illness. My BUN/Creatinine Ratio was an below normal 9. Hemoglobin and MCH were below normal. I guess my question relates to the timing. This thing hit in early December on our unit... before the Chinese government had alerted to the existence of it to the world. Hence our laboratories were not looking for it in specimens. I guess what I’m asking is is it possible the Covid19 virus has been circulating outside of China for a lot longer than we thought? I'm wondering the same sort of thing. I'm from Lorain County, Ohio.  The first reported case here was today, but 3 or 4 weeks ago I got sick with what i thought was the flu.  I woke up in the middle of the night and realized I had a really high fever. I said out loud ""oh no"" when I realized how bad I felt. I took tylenol and called off work, thinking I'd be better in a day or 2.  Strangely though, The fever did not go away for almost an entire week. I've never in my life had a high fever that lasted 6 or 7 days.  I started reading while i was sick in bed and determined that it was definitely a virus, and that it was a respiratory infection. I had never had pneumonia in my life before this. I had super high fever, shaking chills, a bad cough developed and has persisted for 2 weeks after the fever went away. I couldnt keep food down, Smells made me nauseous. I was very dehydrated. There was no talk at the time of caronavirus being where i live, so i followed the advice of my roommates who were also sick (thats how i was exposed)  claiming that its just a normal flu.  I was never tested, but in hindsight I think i might have had this virus.  I hope i did, maybe i have some antibodies for it now.  That was the sickest ive ever been in my life, and first time i ever had pneumonia. Is there a way to test myself now? My symptoms are gone except a light cough lingering. It's not outside the realm of possibility. The first case in the US was discovered on Jan 21 in Washington State. I think it’s entirely feasible that the virus has been circulating for longer that we’ve been aware outside of China, especially considering the high movement of people geographically across the world, and the fact there was a period of delayed action after initial identification of this virus... I guess the only way we could know if we’ve already been infected would be to do a serology test to check for antibodies. I don’t think here in South Australia such a test is available atm. I’d be interested to hear the opinion of an infectious diseases doctor on this. Have you been tested for food allergies such as gluten (in wheat, rye and barley)? Have you been tested for celiac disease? Hi Deuce,,Alot of people wonder if an illness they had was the Coronavirus.Being a retired nurse,and having a history of Pneumonia,a few times in my life,I will tell you,that you can get very ill from it.The last time I had Pneumonia was in 2015..and I had Sepsis Pneumonia,which I was admitted to ICU for...I was gravely ill,didnt know who anyone was,and I was only 56 yrs old and in good health otherwise at the time.Anything can happen I suppose regarding this virus..But knowing you very likely Pneumonia or a Very bad flu ,which can be really bad..Causing Nausea Diarrhea,,Dehydration,high Fever ,Chills,and even Blood clots..If you are concerned I would call your Primary Doctor if its possible.Good luck! Forgot to mention that before I noticed my glands were swelled up before Jan 9 and I mentioned it to my Doctor. On December 25 Xmas I booked a free room at Caesars Hotel and Casino in AC NJ. The room was free because on Xmas very few people gamble as they are busy with family. So, it was an opportunity for me to get away during the holiday. I was gambling all night with a crowd of predominately Asian gamblers. And the COVID-19 origin is supposedly from China. And in my opinion Casinos are the places to pick up diseases. im not an expert but i believe swollen glands mean bacterial infection About the same here, lasted longer because I didn't rest, symptoms pretty close to identical.   I never get sick, been about 20 years since I had flu like symptoms. Quite easily some of the flu patients in the US actually died from it, but how do you tell when 20,000 are already dead and buried? Also, When I had a fever and was very sick I went to Walmart and shopped with my Wife. During our shopping I was so sick I started to faint so I told my wife I was so sick that I went outside and stayed in the car until I was well enough to drive. Stayed home for a couple days laying in bed too sick to go outside. I am an old weekend warrior and I ignore any type of sickness I have had all my life. But, this bug was really nasty. My fever lasted a couple days. And my breathing was stressed for a long time. And I force fed myself and lost a lot of weight down to 168 Pounds. I am recovering now. Had an emergency visit at the Urgent Care Center last week and the ER Doctor diagnosed me with a Stomach Virus. He gave me a Surgical Mask told me I was very contagious and said to wear it all the time. Prescribed me Zofran. Now, I can hold down food and my bad stomach is almost gone. I don't know what I had and there were no tests for COVID-19 last week unless you are an EMT or Medical Worker in my State. Still need to use the Benzedrex Inhaler once a day in order to Breath. Also, I mentioned to the ER doctor that I thought I might have COVID-19 he laughed. I guess everyone has COVID-19? I had a very strange illness on February 28, 2020 that lasted all of half that day.  I remember because I commented to my best friend (and bothered to look back and note it in my Calendar) in text of the mildest of symptoms, as you said ""mildest cold I ever had"", specifically brief ""flash fevers"" that lasted about half a minute or so. Maybe one flash fever about every hour or two. Along with ""brain fog"" which I am also *not* prone to. For about half the day. Never had anything like that before or since. Along with it was the mildest of sore throats and a barely perceptible very rare dry cough; and ""clicky ears"" (Eustachian tube inflammation) which got me worried because since childhood I'm prone to ear/nose/throat/strep infections. Other than that, I've not succumbed to the seasonal cold or flu in several years and take care of my body better than most. Went home and nursed it with known broad spectrum antimicrobial (including antiviral) Citricidal and the the usual no sugar fluids, rest. Took some mondo numbers of quality probiotics as backup army. Gone the next day (a month or more later 2 days of seasonal allergies were in comparison worse, but old school diphenhydramine still did the trick). Just days to about 2 weeks prior to this, but before I'd ever heard of ""coronavirus"" I overheard co-workers saying all the employees were getting sick... Based on the fact that we really don't know a whole lot about this virus, I'd say it's possible, but not confirmed, that any one of us could (1) have already been infected and might not have shown many, if any, of the symptoms, or (2) potentially be carrying the virus but our bodies have something that's preventing us from getting sick. These are very unsettling times we are in so please don't take any unnecessary chances. I have read several testimonies of people that have had the virus. and some science articles about the uniqueness that sometimes you get sick and in 5 to 7 days starts to get better, just to have it come back much stronger. I cannot remember that ever happening to me before. That is the symptoms i had at the end of December, starting January. I got my results from a strep test on the 2st of Jan. Negative for strep. Wished they still had the sample. After it came back stronger I had sever sore throat, Fever for about 2 days, some congestion that was not unbearable. Cannot recall any headache. Typical flu symptoms. All total it lasted about 3 weeks. I work at the USPS as a rural carrier in Ohio, and one clerk there also had the same symptoms. Been trying to find out if and how I can get tested for antibodies. I have read they are somewhat available but cannot find anyone who is testing. Can you test positive after a full recovery from Convid19? Not a test for the virus, a test for the antibodies that your body produces to fight the virus. Typically they will hang around a few months to possibly years.  Depends on your body and other conditions. Dec 15th to January 18th I was sick as well.  I went to the doctor's twice because I've never been sick for that long.  It was a strange sickness.  Heavy dry coughing that got worse at night.  Sore throat, hurt to swallow.   I lost my voice for a week.  Congestion in my lungs.  Fatigued.  The doctor said on the first visit that it was Then on Jan 2nd I went back again because I was still sick with a sore throat and coughing.  This time they said it was (primary encounter diagnosis)TM's clear b/l,   N-congested, T-mild erythema with sl R tonsillar enlargement, no exudate.  I recall the doctor saying that there is something respiratory related going around.  Again, this was on Jan 2nd.  The CDC was notified on January 3rd."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/effective-covid-19-vaccines-but-will-anti-vaxxers-prevent-elimination-of-the-pandemic.3916/,Effective COVID-19 Vaccines?!  But will Anti-Vaxxers prevent elimination of the pandemic?!,"We have all heard about them. People who refuse to get vaccines, or allow their children to get vaccinated. They cite pseudo-scientific publications and baseless presumptions for rejecting vaccines. A correlation to autism is often quoted, as are a number of other maladies. Extensive research however has failed to provide any evidence that vaccines and their preservatives are dangerous to most people.  While some vaccines can cause problems in compromised patients, their effectiveness is without question in eliminating or controlling many diseases world-wide. Oddly, the largest groups of people in the world who are Anti-Vaxxers come from countries with the highest education rates and best health care systems (1). These include the U.S. and European countries. The number of people who may refuse to take an effective COVID-19 vaccine could result in a continuous reservoir of infectivity, torpedoing  a vaccine's ability to eliminate the virus from the human population. On the flip-side to this, some of the poorest nations, with significantly reduced access to educations and medical systems, are those with the highest acceptance of vaccines.  For instance, Bangladesh is the most pro-vaccine country in the world, with almost 98% approving their use (2). There is a good reason for this. Due to the numerous viruses and bacteria that have infected poor nations like Bangladesh, they have no doubt whatsoever that vaccines save lives - they have seen it happen many times against a wide range of pathogens. Right behind them are Rwandans, who trust vaccines 97%!! They too understand in very stark terms what vaccines are capable of - saving millions of lives. Sadly, the global average is a 79% acceptance rate. It has been noted that when people have seen a family member die of a preventable disease, acceptance of vaccines increases dramatically, which comes as no surprise. How can America, and Europe, with presumably the most educated people on the planet, and with the most advanced medical capabilities. have so many people with an ignorant concept of vaccines? Much of it has to do with social media and the spread of false information about vaccines. These people form echo-chambers, spreading false information faster than the virus can spread in a large campaign crowd without social distancing and no masks. The people from Bangladesh and  Rwanda would act so foolishly. They clearly have greater knowledge of the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and the dangers of untreated infectious diseases. It would appear that many people in western nations are not as smart as they think they are! Perhaps we can arrange for some real experts from Bangladesh and Rwanda to visit Americans and Europeans and explain to the Anti-Vaxxers that they have it all wrong, and that vaccines are one of the most important medical interventions to control and stop a pathogenic scourge like COVID-19. Is it possible that the Anti-Vaxxers are simply too ignorant to change their minds?! Have they brainwashed themselves so badly they cannot appreciate why it is so obvious that vaccines can prevent so much human suffering?! Time will likely tell...... 1. 2. Yep  the masses always hear about the  wonders of vaccines even the deaf ones what the mass of people don't hear are the vaccinations gone wrong Let me put it this way if this particle or virus or whatever it is gets into the nucleus of human cells there ain't gonna be a cure it sounds like a long lost particle of earths past is looking for a new host Please provide some references about ""vaccinations gone wrong"" . What does this even mean. ""long lost particle of earth's past""? One might hazard to guess it refers to the ancient nature of the ""particle"" , which is in fact a virus. Viruses are little machines of RNA or DNA, coated with protein (some have lipid membranes) that perform only one function - to replicate and evolve. It has no other function, and no other capabilities. It is much more than a particle, and much less than a cell. I am thinking that maybe with the bats flying around at night the y are eating insects that have concentrated the invisible  light or ultraviolet light and that has morphed into the particle or virus Insects do not concentrate light to be transformed into viruses. At least none that have been reported by science, or ever will be. That should answer this issue. I was vaccinated against yellow fever a couple of years ago and looked into the subject at the time and again recently. Vaccines are generally positive but its important for there to be real openness about the risks and whats going on as vaccines are rolled out There are risks as with all vaccines, that are not much discussed or publicized. A top cancer professor and another person died shortly after having yellow fever vaccinations. Its likely this only got into the news because of the the Professor had links to Prince William. Its not much publicly discussed but the CDC, Dr Fauci and others have quietly highlighted real problems with creating any coronavirus vaccine because of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) which is only seen after a vaccinated patient becomes infected with a coronavirus. Scientific American has stated that ""antibodies typical of ADE are present in the blood of some COVID-19 patients"" On Covid-19 it has been said by Dr Fauci ""Scientists will develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but it could end up only being 50 to 60 percent effective, Dr. Anthony Fauci said Friday."" Separately antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) issues exist with vaccines and were particularly seen in previous coronavirus vaccines for SARS etc In some animal trials there were no obvious clinical signs of ADE but post trial work on the animals showed that they had suffered severe health issues The ADE reaction between the vaccine and the virus has not been obvious in various trials and can be a “serious adverse vaccine event”. The CDC defines serious adverse vaccine event, as when the ""event resulted in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death."" Links to Dr Fauci, Scientific American, peer reviewed clinical trials and others explaining some ADE issues are set out below ADE and Covid-19 American Scientific Article ""Aside from questions of safety that attend any vaccine, there are good reasons to be especially cautious for COVID-19. Some vaccines worsen the consequences of infection rather than protect, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE has been observed in previous attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines. To add to the concern, antibodies typical of ADE are present in the blood of some COVID-19 patients. Such concerns are real. As recently as 2016, Dengavxia, intended to protect children from the dengue virus, increased hospitalizations for children who received the vaccine."" While Dengavxia clearly caused a form of ADE it took a review of 6 years of patient data to determine that there was a problem - and this was done only because of adverse reactions  concerns were raised but were initially dismissed by the vaccine maker and still it is not clear who knew what when ""World Health Organization (WHO) revised its recommendations on Dengvaxia, stating that people who have not been infected with the virus should avoid the vaccine"" ""There is absolutely no way the Filipino government can claim they didn't know about the potential for ADE-dengue in some vaccinated children,"" Lanard said. ""They only have a claim against Sanofi if they can prove that Sanofi dishonestly reassured them that this worry had no basis."" ""Drug maker Sanofi says that its , the world’s first, should only be given to people who have previously been sickened by the virus, according to new long-term data. In a statement, Sanofi said it had recently examined six years of patient data. Scientists concluded that while the vaccine protects people against further infection if they’ve already been infected with dengue, that’s not the case for people who haven’t previously been sickened by the disease."" “For those not previously infected by dengue virus…the analysis found that in the longer term, more cases of severe disease could occur following vaccination,” Sanofi said. “These findings highlight the complex nature of dengue infection.” [or of an ADE reaction to any infection] ADE in Clinical Trial of Coronavirus Vaccine In 2004 a study into a coronavirus vaccine trial looked at liver sections of ferrets and showed that all the vaccinated ferrets had severe hepatitis after being exposed to a coronavirus, but displayed no clinical signs of illness. The unvaccinated trial ferrets only had mild hepatitis in their livers – they were injected with a saline solution / another placebo and exposed to the same coronavirus at the same time as the vaccinated ferrets. Dr Fauci says about ADE and coronavirus vaccines ""One of the things you have to be careful of when you're dealing with a coronavirus is the possibility of enhancement"" Fauci said in an interview with the journal JAMA on April 8. Some vaccines cause a dangerous phenomenon known as antibody dependent enhancement (ADE), which paradoxically leaves the body more vulnerable to severe illness after inoculation. Other researchers have suggested that the severe reactions already seen in Covid-19 could be a form of ADE because of a prior exposure to other coronaviruses, while this is just speculation it seems like it should be researched as part of gaining a better understanding of Covid-19. ADE Long Term Vaccine Monitoring issues Long-term monitoring of adverse vaccine reactions exists, and the CDC has 2 main reporting systems for vaccines – Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) and will now add V-SAFE for Covid-19 Monitoring of a coronavirus vaccine is not simply a question of looking for any initial ADE reaction to a new vaccine - on going monitoring in the general population is needed generally in case trials do not show longer term consequences. The previous experience of ferrets with a coronavirus vaccine implies some human results may not be known until much later. Separately some researchers have indicated other ADE triggers and different Covid-19 vaccines may use different vaccine adjuvants which could also trigger adverse reactions The article below outlines the use of a natural adjuvant for Covid-19 Vaccines ""For all the talk about the cutting-edge vaccines that may just get us out of the COVID-19 mess, little has been written about adjuvants. Perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising: The late Yale professor Charles Janeway famously called adjuvants the “immunologist’s dirty little secret.” These unheralded helpers can turn a half-baked vaccine into an effective one, or stretch a scarce vaccine supply during a pandemic. Not every vaccine requires an adjuvant, but many do: Of the more than 200 vaccines listed in the Milken Institute’s COVID-19 vaccine tracker, approximately 40 percent are protein-based vaccines, which rarely work without an adjuvant. Yet adjuvants have never attracted much funding from industry and government. “Adjuvants have been the weak link in vaccines for the last hundred years,” says Nikolai Petrovsky, a vaccine researcher at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) As we go forward its important that independent researchers can verify what the FDA is telling us about vaccine safety and Vaccine Adverse Events There does not seem to be much simple reporting available to the public from VAERS about any vaccines. VSD data is regarded as much better but is only open to the CDC and its approved researchers. There are indications from the CDC and others working with the CDC that VAERS data has quality issues. A CDC study from 2015 (Tom T. Shimabukuro, MD, MPH, MBA, Immunization Safety Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) states ""Quality and completeness of VAERS reports are variable and many reports lack valid medical diagnoses. The amount of VAERS reporting (30,000 U.S. reports annually) makes it impractical to conduct detailed follow-up on all reports to obtain missing and incomplete information and correct inconsistencies and errors. Because VAERS data do not include an unvaccinated comparison group, it is not possible to calculate and compare rates of adverse events in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals and determine if vaccination is associated with an increased risk of an adverse event"" CDC itself states that ""In 2019, VAERS received over 48,000 reports.  About 85-90% of the reports describe mild side effects such as fever, arm soreness, and crying or mild irritability. The remaining reports are classified as serious, which means that the adverse event resulted in permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death."" The FDA does not provide VSD information to the public, or provide the data via VAERS (or elsewhere?) related to the vaccinated or vaccinated populations to enable a determination of whether a vaccination is associated with an increased risk of an adverse event. Generally vaccines have had positive human health consequences particularly against controlling diseases transmitted from insects etc and things like measles, mumps and rubella, or BCG vaccine etc. That does not mean they shouldnt be improved on and things like toxins and aluminum adjuvants replaced with natural adjuvant alternatives which are already being used but more expensive. However the FDA has not been open as to what progress is being made on vaccine safety despite having had a legal duty to report so annually to Congress since 1986. It is hard not to conclude the the FDA has failed to carry out its duties ""to make and assure improvements in the licensing, manufacturing, adverse reaction reporting, research, safety and efficacy testing of vaccines in order to reduce the risk of adverse vaccine  reactions"" ""Since 1986, HHS has had the primary and virtually sole responsibility to make and assure improvements in the licensing, manufacturing, adverse reaction reporting, research, safety and efficacy testing of vaccines in order to reduce the risk of adverse vaccine  reactions.  In  order  to  assure  HHS  meets  its  vaccine  safety  obligations, Congress required as part of the 1986 Act that the Secretary of HHS submit a biennial reports to Congress detailing the improvements in vaccine safety made by HHS in the preceding two years."" "" ICAN was therefore forced to file a lawsuit to force HHS to either provide copies of its biennial vaccine safety reports to Congress or admit it never filed these reports. The result  of  the  lawsuit  is  that  HHS  had  to  finally  and  shockingly  admit  that  it  never,  not even   once,   submitted   a   single   biennial   report   to   Congress   detailing   the improvements  in  vaccine  safety. "" It would be helpful to have access to the data on all vaccines for things like the infection and death rates plus the data on vaccine adverse effect rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.  A good starting point would be HPV data, the Covid-19 vaccine data when it arrives and then a program to release all vaccine data updates that were required by law since 1986 so that what progress has been made can be clearly seen There has been limited independent research which has identified vaccine problems For example a 2017 study funded by the Danish Govt and others concluded that the death rate among children vaccinated with DTP vaccine was up to 5 times higher than all children not vaccinated (and 10 times higher in girls) Other studies have come to similar conclusions The Introduction of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Oral Polio Vaccine Among Young Infants ""DTP was associated with 5-fold higher mortality than being unvaccinated. No prospective study has shown beneficial survival effects of DTP. "" ""It should be of concern that the effect of routine vaccinations on all-cause mortality was not tested in randomized trials."" It would make sense for the whole subject of vaccination to have much greater transparency and at least a total separation of the FDA vaccine regulator from FDA vaccine research and funders Most serious groups and people who raise question vaccines do not outright object to vaccines, many just want more open data and the removal of things like mercury and aluminum or other adjuvants - basically toxic free vaccines and the use of available natural adjuvant alternatives. Robert Kennedy Junior who is a prominent leader for vaccine risk awareness, more research and debate, has had all his children vaccinated and has stated he is not against vaccines, but he does want openness. However he has been blocked on social media and the press from responding to critics, google censors searches for his web sites however no one from the pharma side will have an open public debate with him about vaccines. Independent views on vaccines are hard to find - the best I could find was Dr. Bernardine Healy MD, former NIH director and former CEO of the American Red Cross she is not an anti vaxxer but has said publicly she believes more research needs to be done into vaccine links to illness - she admits that she only changed her mind after looking at the evidence. In the interview below Dr Healy states that the FDA/government have a formal policy to block research into adverse vaccine effects, which has been set out as policy in writing in reports, and goes back to at least the early 2000s, and Dr Healy says  she believes is unscientific. An open debate is good for all of us - please can we make this about wanting to find out the truth and not about being right or wrong Thank you for an excellent overview of the hazards of vaccines. They are very real and cannot be underestimated. Anyone who has worked with them is aware of much of what you have posted, and you are correct that some of these problems have not been widely disseminated.  Many in the medical community adhere to the principle that people do not need to hear about ""potential"" problems. In can make matters worse. Any ""real"" problems will usually be brought out in clinical trials, which is why the rapid development of this vaccine has been of serious concern to the experts. They know all of this too, and a lot more to be sure. As you must know, these potential problems are why most vaccines take years to gain approval. Your treatment on potential problems provides ample evidence for why this is true. While the adverse reactions to vaccines is potentially very problematic, there is always a risk/reward to such medical applications. Smallpox killed  ca. 500 million people in its last 100 years before a vaccine eradicated it.  Also, it is estimated that 30% fatalities occurred during outbreaks in Europe over the centuries, and other places. When it was brought to the New World by explorers, the estimated mortality rate of indigenous people was estimated as high as 90% because they had never been exposed to it, or any related viruses. One can get ADE from various vaccines (and likely natural infections), and as you pointed out, the original SARS vaccine gave such responses in animal trials. That was using an inactivated form of the virus. I have also read of a possible link with ADE and previous exposure to related coronaviruses, since they do have antigenic sites which are similar. The same observations have be made for influenza. ADE is seen in some flu vaccine patients, and may be caused by the previous year's vaccine-induced antibodies to the next year's mutation(s) at antigenic sites. Reduced binding affinity is likely a primary cause of ADE, and gets worse with age. The effects of ADE (and other potential issues with vaccines) are very real, and a serious problem. It is one of the reasons why they are being very careful before releasing any vaccine for this virus into wide use (at least in the U.S. and Europe). It will be instructive to find out what happens to the Russian and Chinese people who are getting vaccines similar to those being developed by the Western groups. Nobody wants a nasty result from a bad vaccine, but if we are likely to see any soon, it may come from those two sources, which were clearly rushed into use. This is one reason most are being very careful. And the reason I started this thread. The more we know, the lower the risk. While there are many risks as you have pointed out, there is a great need to advance our understanding of vaccines and how to make them work with the lowest incidence of adverse reactions. We will likely need all the experience we can get since there will be more pandemics in the future. Virologists have been warning about them for decades. And this one could be very mild compared to some which could be lurking. Thanks again for your excellent contribution, Adam. A note on the most recent vaccines being developed. Most of these new vaccines are unique compared to the classic inactivated virus in that they present to the immune system ONLY the most important antigenic determinants of the virus - its Achilles heel - the spike protein. This protein is essential for the viral genome to enter the cell. Block it off with antibodies, and you cannot get infected. The newest higher-tech vaccines uses only this protein to attempt immunity. Inactivated virus has other antigens, and need not be used for a neutralizing antibody response. These other antigens could enhance ADE potential since some antibodies will be directed against non-spike regions of the inactivated virus, and possibly result in enhancement. These new vaccines are vector-mediated (mostly RNA carrier), and void of all other virus antigens. The complete viral spike protein is displayed on human cell surfaces, which could in itself enhance a more powerful immune response than free spikes in the blood, or from inactive virus. In any event, antibodies directed strictly against the spike protein should still be effective at preventing or minimizing COVID-19 symptoms simply by blocking its ability to bind to the ACE-2 receptor, and likely another receptor recently found in the nose.  It certainly should limit the risk of ADE since any antibodies from spike-only vaccines will bind to some extent to the spike. The more antibodies one produces against the spike, the less likely it can infect. A great deal depends on the affinity (tight binding) of the antibodies formed against the spike, and their numbers. It is very likely that time will tell how they work out. Hopefully soon, and with good news. My sense is that ADE is being slightly overstated here with regard to sars-cov-2 vaccines. Certainly, there should be some caution given the novel nature of the virus and the historical association of the phenomenon with other coronaviruses, but as far as Im aware, there is no evidence of it occurring with the main vaccine candidates, and so it should perhaps be considered that vaccine researchers have learned from the experiences with sars-cov vaccine work previously, and are better equipped to overcome this hurdle with newer vaccine technologies also now available. Heres a pretty good article discussing ADE relative to sars-cov-2: As to the original opening question, its hard to think that the anti-vax movement wont have some effect, but im confident that it wont have a significant impact on a vaccine-mediated return to normality. It appears that the self-proclaimed Anti-Vaxxers are not the only ones we have to worry about. Many who think the pandemic is a hoax, or maybe just a sniffle, are also indicating a lack of interest in being vaccinated. One imagines ""spite"" has some play in all this. Perhaps they will help out by getting natural infections since most have behaviors to support this concept. We may be lucky if those willing to accept what appears to be a safe and effective vaccine will be enough to end the pandemic. A 60% immunized rate is the lowest estimate, with others up to 80% or more for ""herd immunity"". At this point, we can only hope for the best. Thanks for the link to the Nature article. Yet another long read on my list. There  can be little doubt that Covid-19 is real, and vaccines do much good We all want a vaccine that works and has limited side effects - just lets have transparency and an open debate. People have different views and often do change when engaged in a way that is clear and open. People are generally not stupid but may take time to change Admitting risks and how they will be managed is part of the changing process. We are in a bad place - trust in any politician, the media and others is at a very low level for obvious reasons. We know life has become an echo chamber where people will only seek out that which reflects their existing view and google etc filtering searches to feed back your own interests and blocking information that they determine is not appropriate is making this worse Why do I say this ? Because it is all part of the vaccine issue. Nothing happens in issolation The ADE and vaccine research concerns are very real Even before a vaccine has been developed Scientific American has already reported that ""antibodies typical of (antibody-dependent enhancement) ADE are present in the blood of some COVID-19 patients. Such concerns are real."" Further Dr Healy a former NIH director and CEO of the Red Cross has said that the US Government via the Institute of Medicine has stated in writing that vaccine researchers should ""not persue susceptibility groups"" [in vaccines] ""Do not look for those patients, those childern, who may be vulnerable"" Because it may put people off vaccines See her statement on this between 2mins 50 secs to 3mims 45 seconds into this short interview below. Dr Healy as a member of the IOM says it does excellent work but feels that on this matter it is not a good scientific approach and will stop us finding solutions, but this is the policy that the FDA follows - and was seen in the whistleblower case of FDA researcher Dr W W Thompson (the FDA  has caused harm both to patients and to future trust) The IOM is part of National Academy of Sciences was created by the federal government to be an adviser on scientific and technological matters Further stopping negative vaccine  findings is a general attitude among the vaccine establishment, as can be seen from the ADE issues with the vaccine Dengevaxia ""For Marc Lipsitch, DPhil, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, who is to blame is of less concern than the possible repercussions of the Dengvaxia fallout."" ""Of course the fear is that this can add fuel to the anti-vaccine movement,"" Lipsitch said. ""And unlike previous anti-vaccine arguments, there's evidence that Dengevaxia could increase harm to some recipients."" It has to be seriously concerning that a vaccine was given to 800,000 children despite evidence going back to 2010 of the bad ADE risks with Dengevaxia - denials from Sanofi the pharma company and a general refusal to look into the evidence indicate bad research or a cover up. However Sanofis' own trial data indicated that patients were over twice as likely to have a severe ADE as they were to be seriously infected if unvaccinated. See CIDRAP link below for full info ""All officials who spoke with me about the Dengvaxia campaign worried about the potential for future severe dengue cases in vaccinated persons who had never had a previous case of dengue,"" said Lanard, a public health risk communication expert, in an email. ""They gave me many articles going back to at least 2010, about this unproven but frightening risk with respect to dengue vaccine development."" This can be seen in other quotes from the same article from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP; ""SID-wrap"") Founded in 2001, CIDRAP is part of the Office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Minnesota. The simple solution to the vaccine and drug issue story is to have an independent regulator of vaccines and drugs which has no connection to approving or researching vaccine/drug use and has full access to the VAERS  and VSD data. At the moment those organizations who regulate pharma also approve vaccines and allocate funding and research. This is clearly a huge conflict as are NIH directors going on to head up vaccine divisions at big pharma or those making decisions about vaccines being linked to pharma research grants and jobs etc The number of members of the panel who recommends Covid-19 treatments linked to Gilead is also very troubling - given these are the people who have approved Gileads remdesivir drug which has had limited success Note - this conflict information is very limited and only goes back 11 months and does not include current Gilead associations where no money is currently received (ie others have written in medical journals in support of remdesivir in early 2020 or been involved with the drug in other ways). Conflicts with other drug makers also exist. When you add to this pharmas legal indemnity from vaccine prosecution and that pharma are the biggest political lobby doners at $300 million a year - almost double the next lobby group the - plus the huge media advertizing budgets pharma has which probably effects the media reporting questions only grow. Lets have a vaccine but lets do it in a way everyone can believe in. In the end the truth will come out. Lets not think bad things dont happen - we all now know there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that the establishment and media knew. The impact of what happened in Iraq is tragic for all of us, for the soldiers who went there and especially for the people of Iraq - but no one has owned up or been held accountable I was one of those who believed Let us believe all we are told about vaccines because we are sure the research was properly and openly done on the vaccinated and unvaccinated population, and there will be real reporting of serious adverse vaccine effects on the vaccinated vs unvaccinated population once the vaccines are deployed While much of what you have posted is accurate, I must take a contrary view to the above commentary. It is my considerable experience after watching opinions form and solidify on a variety of topics, it's ""direction"" within a given individual is best predicted by the level of intelligence. Most people who are ignorant cannot, or simply will not, listen to reason because of various psychological issues. Just look at the juvenile behavior of grown people not helping to stop the viral spread. They are increasing its spread, and there are millions of them. And there seems little end in sight. Ignorance is a powerful thing to overcome. Especially when combined with other ingrained belief systems. There appears to be a shift in the willingness of ignorant people to be enlightened by science and reality. They have, as you say, ""different views"". Sadly. some of these views, new ones for certain, can make changing them very difficult.  If they are seeing it as suspect because that is part of their belief system, you will never convince them differently. It appears that such behavior is on the rise, and not easily overcome. Given the current rapidly rising infection rate in large parts of the world, and the likelihood that an effective vaccine wont be widely adminstered for months into the new year, im hopeful that by the time a vaccine actually can be widely offered, we will have enough of a mix of immunity through both vaccine and natural infection, that it significantly reduces the percentage of population still susceptible to infection, or at least susceptible to serious illness owing to an immune-mediated partial protection, thus drawing an end to the pandemic state, and allowing a return to the 'great norm' of the foggy years that preceded 2020. I also wouldnt underestimate how much more attractive a vaccine option will be to some of the dissenters as a way out of the dire economic situation that they are about to find themselves in, if not already. And then it depends on the duration of protection of the natural vs. the vaccine induced immunity, and how much the virus mutates. They are not equivalent. There is no indication yet that reinfections by the current virus represent a serious issue, or that the virus is mutating very fast, though the data is limited.  Last I checked it was mutating at a rate substantially less then the flu virus. That is why stopping the pandemic to prevent further mutation is such an essential aspect for mandates. But it still might continue to replicate at low levels in many if not most infected people, and re-emerge at some time in the future. That is why the other coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, etc. are still around. We cannot obtain lasting immunity due to their rate of mutation. They are survivors, which may forever plague us. The questions then  are : Will we get an ADE response from the last infections/inoculations from a mutant strain in the future? And do we develop another vaccine to knock it out. It could come back less lethal as it came in, or worse. Not sure if that can be predicted, but the more contagious a virus is, the less lethal it seems to become. This has been observed for a number of viruses. Perhaps time will tame this nasty little invader. Interesting thoughts as always. I do tend to think that sars-cov-2 will remain endemic given its propensity for stealth and the scale of a worldwide simultaneous vaccination effort. Perhaps there will be localised outbreaks of a mutated variants, but with a widespread global immunity, you hope that these would remain contained, and not lead to pandemic scenarios; my guess is that they would. Part of the reason why sars-cov-2 has caused such a problem is that most of the world is immunlogically naive to the sars-type coronaviruses, and so looking ahead, even if a sars-cov-3 were to emerge, that was sufficiently close in lineage to its predecessors, there could be some cross-reactivity and perhaps cross-immunity. The same hypothesis would be even more likely with future variants of sars-cov-2, seeing as there are multiple parts of the virus that can be detected by a previously exposed immune system, some of which are more conserved across variants and less prone to mutation. There is also a significant risk for ADE from a third SARS variant, from prior exposure or vaccine to SARS-2, if the antibody levels and their affinity  are not sufficient to neutralize the new strain. China is vaccinating many people using inactivated virus. If ADE is going to be a factor with any vaccine, this one should show it more than any other. It certainly did in ferrets, but the Chinese may have figured a way around this problem. They have had a lot of time to research such things. Remember, the intact virus will result in a wide array of antibodies, many more than just anti-spike abs, with a greater chance of some of them leading to ADE. Time will tell for this Chinese stuff, where safety testing was side stepped big time. They have to be hoping they don't have a problem with it. I have been looking into how many adverse vaccine events (AVEs) are reported each year The CDC reports 48,000 adverse vaccine events for 2019 of which 10-15% are serious meaning ""permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death."" I have also read that fewer than 1% of adverse vaccine events are reported to the CDC on their VAERS system and that the CDC provides no information on what is the ""real"" adverse vaccine events number Does anyone have any info on this ? I found a pro vaccine web site that refers to a Harvard Study from around 2009 that says fewer than 1% of adverse vaccine events are reported to or by the CDC This site dismisses the study but fails to provide any evidence of why the study should be dismissed - it just says VAERS works as a reporting system and the numbers reported do not matter I later found a video of a legal deposition where the Godfather of vaccines Prof Stanley Plotkin reviews the Harvard study [Prof Plotkin is now advising on a coronavirus vaccine, invented the rubella vaccine, is very pro vaccine and consults for major pharma cos] The Harvard study involved 715,000 people and 1.4 million vaccine doses given to about 376,000 people.  ""Of these doses 35,570 possible reactions (2.6 percent of [the 1.4 million] vaccinations) were identified.”” Based on the Harvard study data the report concludes that fewer than 1% of adverse vaccine effects are reported via VAERS. It seems from the Harvard Study that the 35,000+ adverse vaccine reactions in the 715,000 study population was about the same as was reported for the whole of the 300+milion population of the USA in around 2009. Prof Plotkin reviews the Harvard Study and confirms that it says fewer than 1% of AVEs are reported and that it appears that once the study findings were set out in draft form the CDC  stopped co-operating with the research. Its all stated in the video. Also view the link at Has anyone read the Harvard study ? Can anyone comment on the study or the video and the implications of the 1% figure being true ? These are rather strange numbers. The study's ""active"" group involved 376,000 getting 1.4 million vaccine doses? (The rest of the total are placebos, one imagines.) That would mean each person in the ""vaccine"" group of the ""study"" got an average of ca. 3.7 vaccinations of something over the course of the study.  Why would they do such a thing? Are these multiple injections which are required to attain immunity or various vaccines involved? And certainly ""possible reactions"" is very nebulous, anything from a sore arm to worst case. Do you have a direct link to this Harvard study? And I do not doubt that there are many adverse reactions to vaccines. It is the nature of the treatment. Messing around with the immune system can be rather tricky, as many have found out. Your questions are very good, however I think you didnt have all the info about the purpose of the Harvard study which was to see if there was existing effective  reporting of adverse vaccine events in approved FDA vaccines - ie could VAERS be improved. So no placebo group was required as it was a real life study of what was already being done in routine and emergency vaccine health care to see if VAERS reporting was effective. There were 715,000 normal medical patients from Atrius Health, a medical group with about 700 Doctors in the Boston area with patients from infants to the elderly About 50% of the patients had their standard or routine vaccines - some vaccines involved multiple shots over time etc. 45 different types of vaccine were given. Those who did not have vaccines were not due vaccines or did not get them because they forgot etc etc. This was real life situation and showed what was going on by building a new ESP-VAERS CDC approved system from scratch, with proper adverse vaccine event reporting done by Artius Health. Based on the findings proper reporting was not and is not going on in the rest of the USA. My concern is to have real data about Adverse Reactions for ADE, transparency about all adverse vaccine events and how long it took/takes to identify a vaccine risk. This data is not available in a timely or simple way and the Harvard study and other examples below shows the risks are very real and/or badly under reported even for extended time frames Also please remember the CDC is very clear 85-90% of the 48,000 VAERS reports in 2019 are minor but 10-15% are serious meaning ""permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death."" See VAERS link and other info in my previous posts showing the same CDC 10-15% risks over time and in 2009 Its the 10-15% serious cases that concern me - it seems very clear that the Harvard Study highlighted something the CDC still has not reviewed and it looks like it should have as the Harvard study data was presented and discussed by an FDA official and a Harvard researcher at an AIMA Conference in 2009 The Harvard Study Final Report (see PDF link at the end) states on page 6 under the heading ""Results"" The CDC vaccine safety system VAERS reports fewer than 1% adverse vaccine events [of all types both minor and serious] and that these Harvard findings were presented at an AIMA conference in 2009 Most of the info and links I have found are set out below After the system was developed, coded, rolled out, real short term patient data was used for reporting adverse vaccine events and calculations. The Artius Health Drs entered patient data into the new system and filled in the adverse vaccine event forms as and when an adverse vaccine event happened. Over time the data was studied What happened was that 35,000 adverse events were properly recorded and a total of 1.4 million vaccines doses were given There is even a sample PDF of the form used by the Atrius Health Drs to input the adverse vaccine event data into the system with the VSD/VAERS vaccine codes already inserted so that cross checking could be done to validate the existing VSD and VAERS data against the  very detailed and well maintained trial data The Harvard study was HHS/FDA funded for US$ 1Million until to 2009 and appears to have been so successful that Harvard continued unfunded for 2010 After the CDC failed to act on the vaccine findings Harvard developed the system to cover and search patient records for a very wide range of medical conditions and treatments and this remains in use today “Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation.” All the projects vaccine aims were achieved (except the CDC allowing a validation of CDC data by cross checking with the high quality trial data. The CDC admits the VAERS data is of poor quality - see my previous posts for CDC studies ) The Harvard study achieved aims included a fully working ESP-VAERS system and a vaccine adverse event reporting system using real patients and real data - which identified 35,000+ adverse vaccine events of all types Under CDC parameters 10-15% of these vaccine events would result in ""permanent disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness, or death."" See VAERS link in my previous post Some info on the Harvard Study reports on US gov web sites is set out below - also see pdf link for final report and other links later below ""The grant team has a functioning adverse event detection system capable of being expanded and modified to deal with a wide range of conditions. Testing and initial validation are complete. Additional validation was planned as part of dissemination to other sites."" ""The team had planned to evaluate the system by comparing their adverse event findings to those in the Vaccine Safety Datalink project a collaborative effort between CDCs Immunization Safety Office and eight large managed care organizations. Through a randomized trial, the team had also planned to test the hypothesis that the combination of secure, computer-assisted, clinician-approved, adverse event detection, and automated electronic reporting will substantially increase the number, completeness, validity, and timeliness of physician-approved case reports to VAERS compared to the existing spontaneous reporting system. However, due to restructuring at CDC and consequent delays in terms of decisionmaking, it was ultimately not possible to move forward with discussions regarding the evaluation of ESP:VAERS performance in a randomized trial, or to compare ESP:VAERS performance to existing VAERS and Vaccine Safety Datalink data, as was described in the third aim. However, the infrastructure is available and Dr. Lazarus is hopeful that the project may generate additional interest to complete this study."" After the CDC stopped co-operating with the study, Harvard researchers,  developed the system and it sold across the USA to government and private groups - including to the original Artius Health group involved in the Harvard study trial. Current system sales continue to date but it does not seem to be electionically linked into VAERS though some states appear to use it for vaccine monitoring in some way. See users in link below The Harvard study details and quotes above are set out in the links below - US Gov website (HHS/FDA related funding etc) There are several tabs near the top of the page on the links that take you to different reports and on different pages of info - titled Project Description Annual Summaries Final report PDF Etc etc Its also clear that there was a population of patients who were vaccinated and unvaccinated that could have been researched in some way to easily provide some initial findings on if there were vaccine derived health events. As set out at the start my concern is to have real data about Vaccine Adverse Event reactions such as Antibody-dependent enhancement / ADE, transparency about all adverse vaccine events and how long it takes/took to identify an adverse event risks. This last point is never really discussed currently or identified anywhere - its all very vague and not very scientific. There appears to be no system that is publically available or any public reporting of the true figures of ADE or other adverse vaccine events for each vaccine or what if any delays there have been with VAERS identifying a vaccine problem. More and better data should identify the problems sooner Clearly a great effort has gone into analyzing and dealing with the adverse reactions from vaccines. That is also true of the adverse reactions to diseases without having those vaccines to prevent them. and to all pharmaceuticals in general. To be sure, adverse reactions are a common problem in the pharmaceutical industry, and have crap-canned untold billions of dollars in research because something came up sour in many drug trials. It is the primary reason big pharma has cut way back on R & D for new drugs, which is very unfortunate. Obviously it has been known for quite some time that such reactions are inherent in vaccines, and one must always establish a risk-reward aspect to approving them. You obviously have been studying this for quite some time. Sadly I do not have the time to go over all that you have posted, but I am aware of the potential hazards of fighting diseases with, and without, vaccines. Most experts will agree that a vaccine, especially for a virus, is an essential tool in the box for fighting such infectious agents. You cannot kill a virus because it is not living. Totally different approaches must be used vs. bacterial diseases. So vaccines are commonly the only current approach to eradicating many viruses, short of natural immunity. Therein lies the risk/reward strategy. I agree theres a lot of info involved and its really important that extensive drug trial work is already done before any FDA vaccine approval. The links to the info below are set out in previous posts. Post FDA vaccine approval monitoring is a serious weak link. The 2009/2010 Harvard study shows 1. fewer than 1% of all minor and serious vaccines events are reported by/to the FDA ongoing vaccine monitoring system (VAERS) for FDA approved vaccines 2. that this data was publically presented and discussed at a 2009 AMIA medical conference See conference literature PDF linked below - @ page 70 - meeting  S50 An FDA official and a Harvard study researcher are named on the panel S50 N Marks - FDA Professor Klompas - Harvard study researcher Other CDC studies have shown VAERS data is very problematic and cannot be really relied on - the CDC research confirms the data is incomplete and missing etc CDC classifies 85-90% of VAERS vaccine reports as a minor event - 10-15% are deemed life changing through to death Further it makes little sense that the CDC would not allow the cross checking of CDC and Harvard trial results despite that being an agreed Harvard study aim/purpose. That the CDC failed to respond to multiple requests to start the testing/checking processes  of CDC data is recorded in the Harvard study report. So if VAERS collects only 1% of all types of vaccine incidents and much/most data is problematic or about minor events, this means we cannot really know if the ongoing vaccine risks are being properly monitored or later identify when any vaccine issues should have really been picked up post FDA approval by VAERS / FDA  / pharma That vaccine trials and mass vaccine deployments have failed to pick up serious ADE and other vaccine issues is already known. In the case of the Dengue vaccine it took many years to identify the risk, despite later confirmation that the serious issue existed in 15% of those vaccinated - so big improvements are needed particularly in post FDA approval monitoring. This has important implications for all vaccines including the Covid-19 vaccine For those who have not read the previous posts The 2009 Harvard study report data is very significant, with $1million of federal government funding, based on 715,000 real life medical patients normal vaccine requirements, serviced by 700 Drs and 1.4 million vaccine doses of 45 different vaccines given within this 715,000 patient group. The study had 35,000 adverse vaccine events. The CDC reported around 30,000 similar adverse vaccine events a year for the whole USA  during that time (85-90% were only minor events) The Harvard study continued very successfully into 2010 unfunded, the software was developed to use over a range of medical issues and is used across the USA today by government agencies and private medical groups (but not for its intended use to improve the CDC vaccine reporting despite it being a great success) For all that has been posted regarding adverse reactions to vaccines, particularly ADE, it should be appreciated that it is almost certain ADE has existed ever since the evolution of advanced immunity in higher organisms. ADE was almost certainly NOT introduced to humans by vaccines. Immunity, both cellular and chemical, are extremely complex biological activities, and as in any complex biological system, problems can develop which could jeopardize the effectiveness of any ensuing immunological response(s). Simply stated : Evolution has sorted this all out and given us the best it has to offer. Or we wouldn't be here. The only reason we wiped out smallpox and polio is because they did not mutate significantly. Once you have an effective vaccine for these viruses, they are history. Unfortunately, many viruses mutate, which some insist is the most important reason for stopping this pandemic as soon as possible. The more it mutates, the greater the risk of ADE, induced either by natural infection, or any vaccines already given. This is true for all pathogenic viruses which have a sufficient rate of mutation which eventually allow them to evade immune surveillance and elimination. It was recently reported from Europe that millions more mink will be destroyed as they are spreading the virus back to humans, and offering a course of mutation which could increase the likelihood of a more virulent strain arising. Such mutations could also destroy the effectiveness of some, most or all vaccines under development. Indeed, they could not only destroy their effectiveness, but make ADE a more problematic issue for those who have been infected, or vaccinated, using the ""original"" strain. Active medical interventions always fall back on the risk/reward. If you do nothing to eliminate the virus (or others to come), it is possible that mutations will result in a more lethal strain. We already know this from the SARS-1 and MERS relatives There can be no mistake about this. Medical science and application must take into account all the variables to minimize adverse reactions while maximizing disease mitigation. Fighting such diseases are like fighting wars. There will always be ""collateral damage"". The health advantages to the greatest number of people should always be the deciding factor for the distribution of vaccines and pharmaceuticals for treating disease."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/the-new-significance-of-covid-19-in-mink-hypothermia.4368/,The New Significance Of COVID-19 In Mink - Hypothermia,"Has anyone recognized the significance of the recent development of COVID-19 in the farmed mink population around the world and the similarities of it to the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan involving bats.  Mink are farmed in the cold to promote fur growth and their caged status results in very low metabolic rates which produces an almost constant state of below normal body temperature or hypothermia.  The caged bats in the cold outdoor Wuhan markets were also likely hypothermic because of their inability to fly and produce heat from the high metabolic efforts of flight.  Both animal groups were therefore likely hypothermic when fighting the zoonotic coronavirus and their immune systems might have been unable to handle their infections.  This might put a new light on the fact that the vast majority of human COVID deaths around the world are mostly happening to sedentary seniors, diabetics and respiratory ventilator patients that all suffer a form of hypothermia in core body or lung temperatures.  Workers in refrigerated conditions like the meat industry as well as colder seasonal temperatures are also likely causing people to experience some form of mild hypothermia that may be contributing to the second wave of COVID infections.  Maybe it is time to investigate the idea that literally every aspect of COVID-19 has some form of hyp thermia related to it while the people least affected by it are almost hyp thermic with their high metabolisms and ability to produce fevers.  Surely that is worth a more positive approach to research than these constant efforts to disprove, redirect and misinterpret obvious clues. This is an interesting concept about temperature and COVID-19. It is well known that some viruses are better able to infect and cause disease in cooler areas of the body. Which is why rhinoviruses tend to do best in the nasal cavities, where the air cools the tissue, as opposed to the lungs, which are warmer. Regarding the impact on cold temperatures and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, it is not so clear as to what is going on, at least in human populations. Two of the four countries with the most cases are India and Brazil. Both are largely equatorial with higher average temperatures than most countries. The average temperature in Brazil is ca. 75 F, and the average in India is about the same. Of course the temperatures can vary substantially, depending on where you are. The U.S., with the highest number of infections (despite having less than 5% of the global population) has wildly different temperatures, of course, but the heat does not seem to have spared the warmer states, like Florida, Texas, and California. The rates of infection are going up all over, and this is not a result of the onset of colder weather now, since the current surge began long before cold weather set in. It takes time for the rate of infections to catch up to symptoms, and then any continuous increase in spread. The stage was set for the current surge back in late summer. It seems unlikely that bats are significantly impacted by cold weather, at least relative to corona-viruses. While surely some of them die from viral infections, many are simply carriers of these viruses, which  replicate in bats at very low levels to escape immune surveillance. While caged bats may have reduced body temperatures, so do bats hanging in cold caves for extended periods every day. It certainly seems likely that reduced temperatures have an impact on SAR-CoV-2 infectivity. But other factors are also at play, such as innate immunity (or the lack of it), specifically against corona-viruses. The sensitivity to infection in mink is curious, but on the surface would not seem to be related to the cold temperatures, since these animals evolved in such conditions. One would think they would have an active immune system adapted to living in the cold. Caged animals, breed for fur etc, might represent a different set of conditions, however. Above all, it would seem that the affinity of the S protein of the virus for the ACE2 target in any potential host would be the most significant factor, since this is the primary means by which the virus invades host cells and replicates. The higher the affinity, the more likely one will observe pathogenic results. You do not need overly cold temperatures to create hypothermia in seniors, or diabetics that can naturally  be near 35C at a normal room temperature of 23C.  Ventilator patients however get gas that is well below normal  body temperatures piped directly to the lungs.  We are also talking severe cases and deaths not just positive cases .  Nighttime, air conditioning, altitude, refrigeration and swimming can also affect the severity in warm climates.  I suspect the level of hypothermia is directly proportional to the severity of the disease.  Obviously with colder weather the severity of the disease has been increasing. Yes bats live in cold dark caves with normal body temperatures of around 37C but every time they fly they increase their body temperatures by at least 3C because of the high metabolism required for flight and essentially give themselves a Hyperthermic Treatment or fever every time.  Caged for a number of days without the benefits of the warming flights will allow any virus to proliferate much more readily.  As far as the mink you are forgetting they are caged as well and kept cold on purpose to promote fur growth, they are in fact more hypothermic than an active wild mink.  There are also so many more clues as well, were you aware Ibuprofen shuts down your hypothalamus and too much can drop your temperature into the hypothermia range.  How about the smokers paradox, the unexplainable fact that active smokers are totally unrepresented in the COVID numbers.  Researchers have been looking for months at nicotine smoke and still can not figure it out.  Everyone seems to miss the fact that every time a smoker inhales they give their lungs a Hyperthermic Treatment with the hot smoke not unlike what the bat does when it flys.  How about the early 1900s when they used to infect syphilis patients with malaria to create a high enough fever to kill the disease, it was known as Malaria Therapy.  The final issue is that you don’t need the 158F to “kill” the virus protein, you just have to be hot enough to stop it from replicating.  Funny thing though, saunas start at 160F and go up to 190F. This is certainly a distinct possibility. One of the reasons we develop fevers is to fight off infections. If the body cannot develop elevated temperatures, the severity of the disease could increase. The disease was increasing all over the world during the late summer. It seems that internal body temperature has more to do with the severity issue than infectivity. After all, with more infected during the late summer, one can only expect, with the lack of mitigation efforts, that cases are going to rise into the fall and winter.  The issue with cold weather regards people crowded in-doors, and amplifying infections.  This would argue against enhanced temperature to moderate the disease. So while there is agreement on the course of an infection regarding body temperature, the impact of cold weather on contracting it is not as likely (purely from the temperature aspect). There is no doubt that these caged animals are under more stress and certainly more susceptible to infections and disease. But the higher density of animals vs. wild animals also makes transmission of the virus much more likely. But the stresses of caging, and other aspects of their treatment may well assist the virus in spreading, and also increasing its pathogenicity. It is true that smokers are under-represented among virus infections, but the reason is not likely heat. It is believed to result from a sequence of amino acids on the surface of the spike protein which binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (1).  It is believed that consuming nicotine blocks this binding site, and likely moderates the pathogenecity of the infection. The article below offers compelling evidence for this, at atomic resolution. 1. The study you quote is absolutely based on a theoretical notion and it’s inconclusive conclusions as stated will require much further study.  NOBODY has even considered the Hyperthermic treatment of smoke inhalation and therefore no consideration or testing has even been considered.  This does not mean that it falls into the proverbial “There is no scientific evidence to support the theory” it just means no researchers have bothered to test it.   Literally ALL the clues point to hypothermia being a significant factor in the severity of COVID-19 and here is a prime clue that Hyperthermic Treatments may easily be a simple solution.  Surely these obvious clues are worthy of some serious research and testing. Indeed, there is significant evidence tending to support it as fact. To be sure, the concept of nicotine acting to mitigate Covid-19 infectivity may be theoretical, but there are many studies that have demonstrated that smokers are under-represented in infected individuals (1,2). There cannot be too many reasons for why this would be, and is actually expected to have the opposite result. There are references to this in many places. Quoting from (1): "" revealed an unexpected low number of current smokers among subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections"" end quote (That does not read so well as ""theoretical data"",  but does trend to the realm of  ""empirical evidence"".) Quoting from (2): ""Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalization, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19."" end quote One can devise a number of reasons for these clinical findings, but these are the facts. If smokers catch the disease, however, they have a greater chance of severe symptoms. It does not seem likely that inhaling hot air from cigarettes etc. is going to protect one from infection. The heating is very transient, unless one is a chain smoker.  It  would be a hard sell for most that the heat of smoking is going to mitigate viral infection. It is more than likely a chemical relationship. 1. 2. The whole premise of the Hyperthermic Treatment is to “stop the virus from replicating” before it gets a chance to proliferate and then involve the immune system.  All viruses have an optimal temperature of replication usually less than core body temperatures.  It is also believed that they have a maximum temperature that they cannot replicate at all.  Yes it takes 156F to kill the virus protein outright but the maximum replication temperature is in fact obviously within the fever range of bats and human youths.  Technically there should be no way human youths should have these specific coronavirus antibodies so to me that means that the heat of their fever is the only thing left to stop the virus in its tracks before the immune system antibodies are required.  Apparently the heat of inhaled smoke can reach temperatures into the hundreds of degrees but without research nobody will know at what temperature it reaches the lungs. On another note you should also be aware of the two other animals with similar temperature clues associated with mans most deadly pandemics.  The pig (swine flu) has huge temperature issues (BCT range of 38C to 41C) both because it’s lack of sweat glands and it’s lack of hair.  The most deadly disease of all, MERS however, is associated with the camel that in fact does not sweat until it reaches a temperature of 43C to preserve water in the desert.  The one factor that connects all of these three animals is body temperature, no one can deny that, so we would be crazy to ignore the clues without considering and researching them. Firstly, age would not impact the issue of neutralizing antibodies in individual susceptibility to this virus.  No one has antibodies helping them on this one unless they are already infected, and these sometimes do not show up in time for older people. Your notion that fever is all the youth have going for them indicates a  lack of understanding of basic immunity. Young people have much less problem due to much higher immune competence. Their ""innate immunity"", which relies on numerous cellular and chemical components that serve as the front line of defense against pathogens, is at optimal function.  It is ready to go with anything that comes along. As one ages, this function declines, and we rely more on the secondary responses to stop infections, (antibodies, etc.), but these are slower to respond, so we can get sicker as we get older. Try reading some on innate immunity. The first stage is inflammation, which causes fever, and mobilizes all kinds of mechanisms to fight off pathogens. It is certainly not just the increase in temperature. You will find it is vastly more complex than that. Here is a good link if you think this is an acceptable source for information (I use it all the time and rarely find any errors): Otherwise, it is advisable that you find another source to review innate immunity. You will get a much better understanding of why younger people are less prone to symptoms after infection. We have beaten the thermal aspect to death. No doubt there are issues with cold, and it seems likely that there are people studying this. The ideal conditions for replication of the virus are essential to understanding how to control it, and temperature is way up there on that list. I guess all I can say is there are almost 70 million cases of COVID-19 and over 1.5 million deaths so far and up to this point the advanced immunity research has not saved a single life or prevented a single case so far.  Literally all they have is social distancing, masks and hope that those multi billion dollar vaccines MIGHT work.  At this point I am not aware of one single research project that set out to actually physically test the thermal aspect by applying a Hyperthermic Treatment to a COVID patient other than that of the inadvertent active smokers paradox.  Now please tell me again which aspect has been beaten to death and which aspect has been continually buried under misdirection and misinformation. From my perspective, all them."

Which animals to watch out for next?!,"The BBC is reporting that a wild mink captured near a mink farm in Utah was infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). This is not good. There seems a reasonable probability that the virus will spread to other wild mink, and perhaps other wild animals. We also know that cats can be infected, but are not believed to readily transmit the virus. It is now well known that mink can reinfect humans, so this transmission to a wild mink is somewhat worrisome. What other animals do we need to worry about? Not good to have a reservoir of this virus running around out there in the wild even after most of us are vaccinated. Very bad,  actually. The more chances it gets to mutate, the nastier it could become. What to do, what to do....... 1. That is scary, it would be even harder to stop the pandemis with COVID-infected animals running around. Yes, it is very scary. And aside from reinfection from animals, transmission to other species could lead to more pathogenic strains by various routes of mutation. It is often how these horrible pathogens appear. Having this virus circulating and replicating in other animals offers an excellent chance for antigenic shift (1), where two or more strains of a virus form a new phenotype. This is fairly common in influenza, and with this one, all bets are off on what could come out of that, except nothing good. Which is where the smart money would be. The dumb money is still crying about masks, etc. Anybody with ferrets should be very concerned (2). There are an estimated 6 million pet ferrets in the U.S.! When one considers the level of viral spread throughout the country, it seems likely that many thousands of pet ferrets have already been exposed and infected. 1. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via contact and via the air between ferrets 2. For more on this story, visit the article below on livescience.com :"
