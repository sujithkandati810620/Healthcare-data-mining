Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/could-my-family-have-had-coronavirus-in-december.2052/,Could my family have had coronavirus in December?,"I hadn’t considered it before but then I saw an article explaining how a lot of people get gastrointestinal symptoms before the respiratory ones kick in. In December, my entire extended family of 11 got sick. For 7 of us, it began with nausea and vomiting. Of the remaining 4, 2 had nausea and/or intestinal cramping, and 2 had no stomach issues at all. For those with GI symptoms, they went away completely within half a day. Once that was done, the respiratory symptoms started, and they were severe. A dry cough that wouldn’t go away and led to asthma attacks, plus shortness of breath even in family members without asthma. Every one of us also had a high fever which was difficult to break. It lasted a few days, starting before any other symptoms. We all got sick somewhere between a few days before Christmas and a couple days after. The symptoms don’t match the flu or anything else we’d heard of, so we were very confused what we had. Now it does sound like the coronavirus, but the catch is we live on the west coast of the US. The first confirmed case there wasn’t until quite a bit later. Is it still possible we had the coronavirus? Yes you can per the following article. ""“The virus was freewheeling in our community and probably has been here for quite some time,” Dr. Jeff Smith, a physician who is the chief executive of Santa Clara County government, told county leaders in a recent briefing. ... But Smith on Friday said data collected by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local health departments and others suggest it was “a lot longer than we first believed” — most likely since “back in December.”"" Following up on this, looks like the answer is a probable no. If you were in Wuhan, China near end of December, very remote chance. The number of cases were very small at that point."

Most children are asymptomatic carriers. We don't know, yet, whether that is a good or bad thing. In fact, we don't know much about this **** virus, doctors or scientists alike. In your case I would protect myself at work as much as possible (wear 2 masks, one N95, one standard surgical, wear secure glasses, have a lot of sanitizer at hand) and visit my family once or twice a week outside with protection gear. The other way would be to gear yourself and them up with medications (just for emergency), supplements in order to to harden the immune system and move back in there. Also, if you live in Phoenix you have not much to fear in my opinion. The virus cannot replicate easily  (in the current mutation) under heat. Everything above 100 degrees fahrenheit will give it a very hard time and even in 90 degrees fahrenheit will give it a very hard time to replicate (if there is UV-radiation from the sun, which kills viruses in high enough concentration). Everyone in a southern country/state is pretty lucky. Otherwise India for instance would already be devastated already."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/hydrochloroquine.1985/,Hydrochloroquine,"I am a 69 y.o. male. Starting back in late January, early February I felt fatigued, had a bit of a dry cough and the worst part was an annoying shortness of breath. This lasted for 2-3 weeks and during this time I had 3 days that I felt nauseated and had diahrea. Frankly I still have a morning cough even now, but it has been productive for a while and is almost gone. This never got to the point of me feeling like I needed to see my Doctor and C19 was on the news but supposedly not here in the US yet. It wasn't until recently that I put this all together. I may have had it already. When things settle down I will see about an antibody test. What is interesting is that I have been taking Hydrochloroquine daily for over a year now prescribed by an RA doc. Makes me wonder. There was a study in Iceland recently, where they found out, that a big potion of the infected is asymptomatic (50% in the case of the test population of the study ). An even higher amount would include the people with mild symptoms, who also usually do not report themselves. This would mean a much lower mortality rate than currently computed. Anyway in my view this virus is worse than the flu, because the symptoms last much longer plus the bad symptoms (severe breathing problems, kidney and testicular pain) come in waves, whereas with the flu you have 2-10 days straight symptoms, so you know, if you are eventually healed and good to go. Is Hydro OTC in the US ? Awesome move if true and good, that it helps you ! Spread the word if you do not have any side effects. I think I need to clarify some things: I did not say that hydroxychloroquine helped me. I only reported factually what my experience was with what MIGHT have been mild C19 symptoms and that I have been taking hydroxychloroquine for the last year.  I was never tested for C19, I will however get an antibody test as soon as they are available. As far as it being an OTC drug, it is definitely not OTC. Don't jump to conclusions based on what I reported. Maybe you had the flu, it was out there.  It will take quite a while before someone makes sure sense of all this data. One might help track such things with purchase records.  Purchase records are probably the most studied real time data there is.   They ought to be able to track colds and flu thru it. Yes flu is a definite possibility, I got vaccinated for flu last October so it could have been flu but mild. The thing that really makes me wonder though is the shortness of breath, I have never experienced that before. I couldn't walk 20 feet without having to stop, I thought I was going to pass out a couple of times."

By this time however there may be something of a ""herd immunity"" which may be beginning to kick in. I don't trust their numbers at all. You absolutely cannot trust any stats coming out of China.  ALL stats are controlled by the gov't to pass the message that they want passed. The numbers in China are very much faked, as their population is about 4 times bigger than the US, yet supposedly haven't even hit 100,000 cases.

Writer needs to answer the question the headline teases sooner. The Flu Vaccine's most common side effect are Flu Like Symptoms. Do we need patients with Flu Like Symptoms to require medical attention during the end of the Flu Season? Would not it be better to spend our resources on prevention during the COVID-19 event? In My Opinion. You know how to read! That's exactly what it said. um they did......... Honestly, this is an irresponsible headline that seemingly gives validity to one of the most inane questions asked by an idiot President.  Most people don't read articles, just headlines, so this will just validate to them how intelligent their President actually is while ignoring how scientifically uninformed the question was. Also, as someone else pointed out, and as anyone who has gotten a flu shot knows, flu-like symptoms are a common side effect of the vaccine as your body builds immunity.  Do we really want more people to have those symptoms, possibly rushing for care or testing or even masking and actual COVID-19 infection? I usually love this site.  Today I'm very disappointed. An intelligent opinion, better thought out than the whole of this article. The flu season extends into May. If you did get a flu shot but still end up catching the flu anyway, you might not actually have the flu. You might have this SARS 2 thing that seems to be going around. The flu shots common side effects do not include flu like symptoms.  If you think it does, you haven't had the flu in a long time.  In the vast majority of cases, some redness/soreness at the site of injection, a very mild fever and not much else is what you would feel.  Someone with the full blown flu would have respiratory distress, serious body aches, mucus out the wazoo, and not at all look like someone ""suffering from flu-like symptoms from a flu shot"". Sleet,  speaking of being ""Scientifically uninformed"" I find the Science world today being "" Uninformed.  Boasting themselves to be wise,  they have become fools. I have an encyclopedia published in 1953 that states ""we know that there is life on mars, for this is evident due to the seasonal color change of the planet.  In 1963  Scientist declared that humans evolved from Apes. Genetic research has since stated that we did not come from Apes but rather, all humans came from one female.   The big bang has now been debunked since new evidence indicates that the universe is increasing in expasion rather than decreasing. Now Scientist are saying the Universe may continue to expand forever.      Explain that one. Now you are in the realm of GOD. I don't know if they can claim this as fact yet.  And we are just going to end up spreading more panic if they get symptoms from their flu shot and run to the hospital.  People posting that are correct.  Do we want thousands racing to hospitals and making the truly ill people not get fast treatment??? PLUS they may be racing right in to getting the corona virus from people in hospital that DO truly have it. Here's what keeps throwing me---if we can have a few weeks before we show signs, then we get it and recover, but you find out your family member got it as you were healed.  THEN THIS COULD JUST GO ON FOREVER.   Now they claim people can get it again?  This is going to be such a battle to fight and hopefully eradicate. Personally I am not nearly as afraid of this virus as I am what we witnessed in Italy yesterday.  The riot at prison and people panicking.  The  PANIC is what will create most of our problems.  People will walk off jobs for fear of getting it, then what??  Everything grinds to a halt and we have the TOTAL CHAOS we witnessed after the hurricane of New Orleans.  That crowd lost it in around 3 days and became d*** near crazy and uncivilized.  THE PANIC IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE VIRUS.,in my opinion... You mean that scientific statements are bad because they are improved from time to time? That's a positive! The more we study and improve them, the better our conclusions will be. That's science's greatest strength. We can improve upon what our ancestors found, to better understand our place in the world. wow maybe folk choose what they do and do not read on this forum  but  do yourself a favour DO NOT GET LAST YEARS FLU JAB go read my post ,and before the keyboard doctors pile in with it beig seasonal flu ,,,,,think again The Flu Vaccine's most common side effect are Flu Like Symptoms. it's a viral infection  which this year has every symptom of coronavirus ,from start to finish don't believe me get a healthy person give him/her the flu jag{ 2019) within 5 days you will feel lethargic by the 6th 7th day you will have the sweats a sore throat and headaches ,aching muscles These will pass within a few days but the persistant cough and runny nose , the lethargic and muscle aches will stay and this  will take over followed by breathlessness you will find it worse when you lie down and harder to breath after a week you will have a crackling in the lungs when you breath  and after you have sought medical help like i did you will be lethargic/tired and weak 14 weeks after you first had the jag for all the ones who claim get the flu jag and this has nothing to do with the seasonal flu jag, i say go ahead give it a try then come on and tell us how you feel i and others have all had it and each had the exact same symtoms I had the same flu shot and felt nothing. Maybe this is an isolated event. I feel sorry that you seem to have negatively reacted to it, but the flu shot is an important part of staying healthy. Also, it could have been something else. Correlation does not imply causation. A closed mind is a terrible thing I'm sorry you had such a bad experience with the flu shot. I never got a flu-shot in my life, so I cannot comment. Other vaccines also made me feel ""weird"" for 2 days, but nothing bad. The symptoms you list do not sound like they are attributed to the current Covid-19, sounds more like a bad flu to me. Perhaps you had both, the flu and covid-19. We are living in great times. 🥳 And a mind that spends time trying to start an argument on a science forum is even more terrible."

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/evidence-that-the-virus-is-losing.1722/,Evidence that the virus is losing,"Examining the data for each county shows that the number of infections and the number of deaths is no longer growing exponentially for most countries. To do this, look at the logarithm of the number of deaths vs time. It is clear that the exponential phases are over in most countries. For example, Italy is below. Go ahead and repeat it for Italy, Spain, China, Iran and France and you will see the same pattern. The total deaths are leveling off. I am not going to post all of them because that would be too many images, but all the ones I have looked at do look like this. Apart from USA, which is still exponential at this time. So it looks like only around 10K people will die in Italy of ""coronavirus"".  But Italy is supposed to be the worse hit, where it is absolute hell and they can't even dispose of the bodies because never in history has this number of people ever died before... blah blah blah.... oh, apart  from a couple of years ago when 25,000 people died from the seasonal flu and Italy did not shut down anything, in fact it was not even reported as a big thing on the news in my country! Given that we do not know whether these 10K people actually died from a fatal viral load of SARS-nCoV-2 or from something else, and given that last flu season had 25,000 deaths in Italy from the flu... I leave you all to draw your own conclusions. When the axis is logarithmic, any positive angle represents exponential growth.  What is most important is the derivative of the function which reveals the rate of change of the exponential growth.  It is encouraging that the rate of change of exponential increase is slowly decreasing.  With that said, the exponential growth is still occurring. Look at the following data showing (US Deaths) to see the rate of change decreasing: With the coronavirus being an ever present concern all around the world, people are being much better about following guidelines to slow transmission, which has the added benefit of letting pockets where the virus has reached high levels start to reduce as more and more people come out of the other side of the illness. If people keep listening to experts and remain committed to following best practices, we're likely to see improvements continue. There is no way to completely predict how things will play out, but there is ample reason for people to remain hopeful. Nothing beats trusting the experts and following their advice. It's not that every piece of information by every expert will always prove to be 100% true, just that experts get to be experts by years of study and a lot of first hand experience in handling similar issues. Yes, there are many experts and they seem to have conflicting viewpoints.  Everyone of us For instance, experts in disease control (CDC) have in mentioned that masks are not recommended as they don't stop the spread of the virus. Yet scientific results, peer-reviewed and published at NCBI, US National Institute of Health say otherwise. I personally trust the scientists and the logic that its better safe than sorry.  Other nations which were hit with SARS years ago .  Go figure! But it really doesn't stop there.  There is so much blindly regurgitated information, in fact 99% of it is regurgitated, skewed or unfounded!  Let's look at a few more points here: What is the real death rate?  Every single expert source (except myself) agree that the death rate is: (the number of deaths / number of cases) = probability of dying (~2-3.6%) Yet if you just stop and think about it for a little while you will realize how wrong this logic is! Much more accurate and logical is: (the number of deaths/closed cases)= probability of dying (please think about this until you understand clearly). Using the latter formula you will see an accurate representation of the experienced death rate per each country. This representation is able to much more correctly present the number of future deaths. It was apparent to me (but seemingly nobody else) in early March that China had given the world false data.  Yet every source still pools in the China data for the world total percentages.  Of course this greatly skewed the data!  As data from other countries increases, the predicted numbers are moving up, since the China data is a smaller percentage of the overall data.  An easy way to remove the skew is to subtract out the China data. Yet it has only been in the last few days that many are starting to realize this. The spread of wrong information by experts doesn't stop there!  Let's examine some more important points of dis-information. In a statement released by the experts at the FDA: ""Silver has never been shown to be effective against any disease"" Yet lets examine what scientific results show in peer-reviewed papers at the NCBI US National Institute of Health Library. You can find a collection of such documentation here: Once again, the statements and advice of experts is not always well founded and sometimes it is completely wrong.  Although the misinformation may be unintended, that does not make it not harmful.  It's eye opening that so much information is in disagreement with thousands of documents by accredited scientists! It doesn't stop there either, but I have made my point. People, you are being misinformed and this is as clear as the conflicting viewpoints being given by experts."

We are going to watch this thread very carefully to ward against conspiracy theories and other disruptive misinformation. I know but it is scary that it came from no where ,, why,sounds impossible to me these are the things we study and make for war I was with the  us weapons division for 18 years Unfortunately, the chaos of nature itself is quite capable of creating viruses like this, and has done so for untold millions of years. There are many studying this particular virus, but new ones emerge rather often - luckily most of them are not as damaging and just result in the ""common cold."" I did not ask if SARS-CoV-2 was a result of a biological weapon development, I still believe that that specific assumption has been disproved. What I asked was simple: Can the SARS-CoV-2 be part of a medical research trying to find a weakened Corona virus that could be used as inoculation against a new harmful virus? Of the seven known Corona viruses known to infect humans one causes the common cold, three cause the flu, the rest caused pandemics: SARS, MERS & COVID-19. While the rest of the world abandoned research on inoculation against SARS when the virus SARS-CoV-1 vanished, did China continue such research? Could SARS-CoV-2 be a step along the way? It seems to be a much weaker and less deadly than SARS-CoV-1 or the MERS virus. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 is so contagious is why it is such a serious problem, more a logistic problem than a medical one - just the shear number of people who need hospitalization and the ones that continue on to needing a bed in ICU wreaks havoc on the medical staff in the hospitals. I am not suggesting a conspiracy theory or asking for one. I just want an answer, if one exists, to my simple question above. Chinese government is lying.  They are lying about how many deaths, and how they controlled the virus so quickly.  I believe they are even lying about patient 0.  I think it was much earlier.  You have to ask, "" If this was naturally created, why do they feel like they have to lie or try to protect themselves?"" Sars came from China, this in my opinion, is strike two. I'll even go a step further and say ""sue China"" for damages due to negligence.  See video below.  It will open your eyes RNA modification synthesis process do exist, guess only time will unfold."

This adds to my worries about my family Might I ask how you get a hold of the equipment that you distribute? If you were to walk us through to how your daily routine is, maybe we'd be able to pick apart a portion of the routine to help safeguard you.

Management seem to think its ok, i'm concerned about infected equipment coming back which is infected. management shrug it of We re-issue equipment after it has been clean. We also provide new equipment but mostly re-issue For your sake, since you're stating that the residents in your flat are at high risk, you should either make sure you're disinfected prior to meeting up with your resident occupants or you should leave the post you're in. You should probably see if you can talk to management to see if the people returning the equipment can disinfect them before handing it off. Surface transmission would be the key mode of infection for you, since you're handling equipment. If you're cleaning the equipment, then well, disinfect yourself and any exposed part of your body(to the air) before entering your home.

In other words, the DNA in fungi more closely resembles the DNA of the inhabitants of the animal kingdom. We are nearly 100% alike as humans and equally closely related to mushrooms. This is the reason why the fungi's are able to chemically hide and do so much damage to humans. Thermally Dimorphic fungi, cause infection following inhalation of spores (conidia) into the pulmonary system. Once in the lower respiratory tract, the conidia transform into the yeast phase by secreting enzymes, which is susceptible to phagocytosis by the pulmonary macrophages. The action of the fungus's feeding on the human cells, is what causes the protein to evolve and that is how the disease(s) actually start. What the fungi's are doing inside the human, is exactly what they do on a forest floor as a mold. When it is inside a human cell (Animal) and in the form of a yeast, the following is what it does (explanation from ): Typically in asexual reproduction, a single individual gives rise to a genetic duplicate of the progenitor without a genetic contribution from another individual. Perhaps the simplest method of reproduction of fungi is by of the , the body of a fungus. Some , which are single-celled fungi, reproduce by simple , or , in which one cell undergoes nuclear division and splits into two ; after some growth, these cells divide, and eventually a population of cells forms. In filamentous fungi the mycelium may fragment into a number of segments, each of which is capable of growing into a new individual. In the laboratory, fungi are commonly on a layer of solid nutrient inoculated either with spores or with fragments of mycelium. which is another method of asexual reproduction, occurs in most yeasts and in some . with the of . , and the other remains in the parent cell. and repeated nuclear divisions. and even before . Buds that are pinched off a hypha of a filamentous fungus behave as spores; that is, they germinate, each giving rise to a structure called a germ tube, which develops into a new hypha. Although fragmentation, fission, and budding are methods of asexual reproduction in a number of fungi, the majority reproduce asexually by the formation of spores. Spores that are produced asexually are often termed mitospores, and such spores are produced in a variety of ways. Several species of TDF, contain important pathogens of humans and other animals. The major human pathogens in this group are: , / , , / , , and (formerly known as ). The majority of these organisms are primary pathogens (as opposed to opportunistic), with the ability to cause disease in healthy humans who encounter them in endemic areas. Whilst there are thousands of papers already published about the above, the thing that science is missing and why they are not finding a cure, is it is looking for the protein, but doing so in the wrong place. I have already found several of the corona virus origin's within the above group and continue to cross check the protein bio's I have gathered against the latest data. The most compelling evidence I have discovered so far, is nothing short of an exact match to the COVID 19 virus protein bio, which is distinctive in that it has multi-polar ""buds"" or"" spikes"" and resembles a ships wheel. This is causes mucous membrane ulceration of the mouth and nose with spreading through the . A hypothesis for entry of the fungus to the body is through . The route of infection is assumed to be following which the infective propagule gives rise to the distinctive multipolar budding yeast forms in the lung resembling a "" "" seen in histological sections. Both immunologically normal and compromised people are at risk for infection. The lungs, lymph nodes, and mucous membrane of the mouth are the most frequently infected tissues. Now look at the picture below..... I have tweeted several heads of state, CNBC, CNN, BBC, SKY just so they can get the scientists to look at the data I have, but no replies. I may be completely wrong, but why is it that I appear to be the only person on the planet who has joined all of the dots together and figured out in 7 days and nights, what science appears to have missed in over 50 years? I am desperate to stop people getting and ill and dying and have been up for literally 7 days and nights to figure the answer out. I am only interested in saving as many of the lives I can from all over the world so need some help to get this info out to the scientists and politicians. Please spread it about. From the sound of this, it certainly seems as if at least some few scientists should be at least briefly allocated to checking this out. This might support your theory considering the patient zero location. They were developing yeast products in Wuhan. ""the features such as quality, liquid growth state, microscopic feature is as cellular form under opticmicroscope or electron microscope, thalline is spherical in shape, ellipse, oval, lemon shape; Physiological and biochemical property comprises the fermentation of different carbohydrate and the assimilative capacity to carbon source, nitrogen source compound, to physiology characteristics such as salt, alkali, acid, temperature tolerances.Bacterial strain 24M is belong..."" Also, bats eat fruit based products that contain yeast. I wonder if this fungal strain contaminated their diet. The problem is a virus is not a life form , it is like the undead...It does not have the machinery to reproduce. Hence it requires a ""host"" to invade its cells and reproduce  within it using it's reproductive machinery.  A fungus is a life form and can reproduce without a host cell. Though it requires a host organism to feed on it reproduces  on it's own  What you have found is a  organism that resembles the virus in apperance . But if can reproduce without invading a host cell ..it isn't a virus. Budding yeast is viral. University of China has already confirmed this. Coronavirus Thanks, I was confused Aiii. I sense quiet a few fundamental errors This is your claim. Besides the fact, that the ssRNA genome of the SARS-CoV-19 is already known. Let´s go: Aiiiii. This one here hurts a lot. Let´s get it straight: There are 6 different ""life kingdoms"": Bacteria Archaea Viruses Fungi Algae and Protists Fungi can be single-celled or multicellular organisms. They are predominantly found in soil or on plants, but they have been discovered in almost every other habitat on earth. But yes, they can also pose threats to human health, for example, candida infections. An no... just absolutely no... xD humans are NOT single-celled organisms... By genetic facts, only approx. 10-20% of your body´s genetics, actually truly belongs to your own, personal genetics. The rest are other, single- and multi-cellular organisms. Humans are a ""single body"". And by far the  most part of it, are microbiomes. Such as our belly flora f.e. The genetic similarity between humans and fungi really varies of what exact breed of fungi you are talking about. Bananas have a very similar genome like us humans, as an example for plants. This claim misses too many factors to be count, before doing a finished statement, as you say here. Overall I´d say it is half correct, but also half wrong. By fact, mushrooms can not easily ""hide"" from our immune systems. As nothing can easily hide from it. Good police our body has. Basically one can say, this is almost a description for the process of DNA transcription. You would need to direct this statement more specific towards this fungi you are reporting about. Someone already said it in the comment section. A mandatory difference between a virus and a fungi is that, a virus ""lives and reacts"" through bio-chemistry. And entirely through it. It is not really a ""living thing"", like a fungi. Therefor needs a host cell to ""hijack"" it´s genome in order to reproduce. So far by my knowledge, the process of incubation of this CoviD-19 has been monitored often enough to proof it´s existence to be a virus, and not a yeast-fungi. You must ask yourself, what are those ""buds"" or ""spikes"" in the matter of Molecular Biology? The  media calls it so stupid, I can not listen to them anymore. So might be a good homework for you to find that out. I think if you already did, you might have call it also as it is supposed to be called. There are already quiet many patents regarding different Coronaviruses. Just google it up. It´s properties for proteinase are very famous, therefor I suppose that was initiated by mutation to phenotypically appear so different for you. Not to forget, there are already two known mutations of the SARS-CoV-19. One more dangerous, another less dangerous. Science did not miss it the properties are still very clear about, that it is a virus and not a fungi. If it was the fungi that you say so, then the symptoms would have a less vast variety, then it does already. Asymptomatic would be much less possible then it is. And the spread of it might create a cluster of spores, and won´t need a phenotypical CoviD-19 looking vector to spread. Through autopsy on CoviD-19 patient bodies, I don´t think they won´t have notice if it was a fungi and not a virus. Or maybe you want to give more specialzed statements about this fungi. I will research about it when I have time. Or maybe you can collect some study papers together for me already. I am also pretty busy nowadays. Edit: no Wikipedia links please ^^ Edit+: Here you can see some strong differencies in their phenotypes. and ______ And some other, interesting studies. Not to mention there is also  *I believe.... a size difference  that equates to several magnitudes,  between a single celled life form and a virus such as the Sars COV2 or COVID 19 virus. Okay , my curiousity is endless so "" You made me look"" LOL Coronavirus COVID 19 70–90 nm in size Microscopically, yeast cells of this fungus are large (8–12 µm in diameter µm = micrometer or 1 millionth of a meter. So  8-12 millionths of a meter compared to 70-90 nanometers One 1000th of a micrometer is a nanometer, or nm. It appears hundreds if not thousands to tens of thousands or even more of Coronaviruses could live inside a single fungus cell! Those spikes are a receptor protein, I think S. It attaches the virus to external ACE2 protein on human cells. Much is known about viral reproduction and I think you should check it out. It is quite interesting. I’m from Brazil and we have patients with paraccocidioidomycosis here.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/how-deadly-is-the-new-coronavirus.1180/,How deadly is the new coronavirus?,"All estimates of coronavirus mortality should be taken with a grain of salt, but scientists are beginning to see differences based on age and access to medical care. Stephanie Papas wrote a good article, unusually well balanced, with one flaw. A case-fataility ratio of 0.8 is 80%. She probably meant 0.8%. Or possibly  'case-fatality ratio' is a medical term that implies percentage, though general readers wouldn't know that. Amphioxus, your point is undeniably True, but considering EVERY other reference to a case-fatality ratio in the article has a % sign after the digits, I am thinking your observation is somewhat trivial, putting it nicely.   You  referring to what is commonly known as a ""typo"". All that aside, what a pity the overwhelming bulk of that which passes for ""journalism"" on this planet,  lacks the ability to stick to facts and  make only logical conclusions, and avoid sensationalistic exaggeration, in the manner of this quality article. For individuals with underlying conditions, the occurrence of serious, detrimental  health effect is upwards of six to eight percent.  e.g. Diabetes,  Hyper Tension.   Individuals up in age are also more vulnerable than the at-large population.    That's nothing to treat casually. Watcher, I am not disputing that, but do you have a source of information for saying that?  thanks Fatalities are now at 7. In as much as it's possible to do the napkin math for cfr (probably not super accurate), that napkin number goes from 0.8% to 1% So many unproven assumptions and uncertainties that few seem to consider, much less care about, or report about.  If you have a spreading infectious agent with a lag period of approx.14 days before symptoms show, there is no way one can accurately estimate the ""number of infected"" versus the number of dead.  The former is uncertain, while the latter is documented. (Except in China).   People only get counted as ""infected"" when going to the hospital with symptoms and worries. Infected people with few or no symptoms never go to the hospital. That number going to the hospital could be 1 for every 100 infected, or 10, or 1 in 1000.  Nobody knows for certain, and everything about the number infected is purely hypothetical.  So the percentage of people who have already died is artificially inflated due to the unknown and uncounted numbers of non-reported infected.  And hence, the predictions on the percentage of who ""will"" die in the future therefore becomes a crap shoot. For example, if there are 10,000 people infected, but only 100 get symptoms sufficient to go to the hospital, and out of that one person dies, then the rate is 1% by the reported sick, but it could be 0.01% of the total infected. Add to this the uncertainties in the CoVID19 testing methods.  They use PCR methods which are highly unreliable, with high rates of false positives, and many unproven assumptions.  The PCR methods react to DNA and RNA fragments, not entire DNA chains, which can be from COVID19, or from any number of other antibodies from other viral exposures.  All that can be said is, those who test positive share a certain percentage of infectious foreign blood proteins, bits and fragments of DNA or RNA, similar to those who perished from assumed CoVID19.  ""Assumed"" is the key issue.  The situation is so bad that Dr. Kerry Mullis, who invented the PCR method and got a Nobel Prize for it, has denounced the use of this method for diagnostic purposes. One thing is certain, however, when the PCR tests are rolled out in a big way, so that everyone in a ""risk group"", or who has a cold or ordinary flu gets them, the numbers of false-positive ""infected"" will soar dramatically, and cause even greater hysteria and panic, without legitimate or scientifically-defendable reasons. All the rest of the claims and ""authoritative statements"" about CoVid19 are mostly academic-medical posturing, in an environment where -- like with ""climate change"" issues -- dissenters who raise warnings as I do above, are excluded from the discussion and debates, or literally erased from professional standing, and silenced.  Primarily this whole thing is being pushed by CDC and WHO ""experts"" who love to be in the limelight, who have patent rights on various meds used in this situation, who chase Nobel Prizes, and have strong biases towards boosting all kinds of federal and insurance money to boost up authoritarian trends in the growing medical-pharaceutical institutions.  All this nonsense about ""sheltering"" and forbiddance of group meetings merely delays infections among the general population who will never get sick from it. That will eventually lead to a total population ""herd immunity"", without protection of the high risk individuals.  Rational opinion argues to spend time and energy protecting the elderly high-risk groups, who are already heavily medicated and suffering from other things. But when they die, what is it actually from?  Just look at the other headline at Live Science:  "" The CoVID19 virus? Another virus? Ordinary pneumonia? Or one of the many original disease problems the patient reported, compounded by unnecessary and toxic anti-viral medications, and the fright of being isolated behind plastic with a presumed death sentence, and away from family? Remember AZT, the toxic anti-viral that was fed to gay men and IV drug injectors at 1500 mg/day, leading to death rates of over 50% in a year, ~80% in two years?  When it was discontinued, they lived longer, and this was heralded as a ""breakthrough in the war against AIDS"".  Authentic history will rather call that an end to the epoch of AZT murder of patients by arrogant doctors who figuratively gave the middle finger to HIV critics. Remember the infectious SMON disaster in Japan, killing nearly everyone, thought to be an infectious disease, but which turned out to be bad reacitons from coquinol drugs, an anti-diarreah medicine?  Complaining of an upset stomach led many, step by step, into the grave as increasing amounts of coquinol made diarreah worse, leading to ever-more ""medicine"" and finally, death.  One lone physician made the discovery, and was successful to announce it by Japan's much better science and medical journalism than we have in the USA, ruled as ours is by arrogance and posturing individuals. Remember the ""infectious Pellagra"" epidemic of the early 1900s, thousands died in medical detention, turned out to be a deficiency of vitamin B3, from corn-based diets of rural southern poverty.  Adding a bit of brewer's yeast into the diet and ""infected"" people recovered. OH, didn't learn those things in medical school, or journalism school? Naturally, the medical profession has its own falsified history where much of these things are erased, except in lesser-known journals.  And if you are an honest journalist and report such things, you won't be employed for long.  Just look at what happens to anyone who dared to criticize the current ""climate change"" hysteria, being fanned by Al Gore and Greta Thunberg!  Movie stars, journalists, scientists, they all get punished for daring to go against the current Madness Of Crowds. James DeMeo, PhD One thing.  They are counting those who have underlying medical conditions, who are elderly, who have weak immune systems, etc, among those who have died.  If  you remove those numbers because they died due to a previous medical condition, then the number of deaths will go down dramatically.  You can't say hundreds of thousands died from the virus when the virus only exacerbated another condition.  I am not saying that it didn't kill them but it was not the main reason.  People need to look at the number of people who die WITHOUT any other medical condition being involved.  The article said that those above 85 or 90 are at the highest risk, well yes because their bodies are weaker and have a harder time fighting disease.  But the numbers of those at risk goes down the younger you get.  How many young people have died?  A man in a county near where I live died at the age of 40 something but had a medical condition as well. So, in reality, how many people have actually died that did not have any other medical condition, were elderly, etc.  That is what needs to be put out there. All well and good, but fact remains if you're bad enough to get tested and be positive, the numbers are there for total cases.  The WHO said the mortality rate on 3/8 was 3.4%, but that included a LOT of people with mild symptoms.  With a shortage of tests (in the US anyway) and mild cases being told to stay at home and self-isolate, people getting tested now are at ""Stage Four"" with shortage of breath - these cases are worse than those in Feb/early March. The ""active"" case mortality rate is now 5.4%, slowly rising.  The ""closed"" case mortality rate (people will either recover or die) up from 5.7% on Mar 8 to 20%, and still rising.  Other metric that's changed is how many cases are unresolved... this was about 40% on Mar 8 and is now 74% (worse cases take longer to resolve), and for whatever reason appears stable.  A picture is worth 1000 words... The US is different because we just started testing... AMR is 2.6%, CMR is 36%, with unresolved cases at 93%. I suspect the answer to that is a case-by-case situation rather than a hard percentage.  There are too many unknowns and un-remarked variables to generate a specific value for this question. Table 2: Estimated rates of influenza-associated disease outcomes, per 100,000, by age group — United States, 2018-2019 influenza season Well if there are any questions how bad Coronavirus is bad on people with Diabetes here is what the ADA says. Using death rate can be misleading given that we don't know the real number for those infected.  This is why death rates varies so much from country to country.  Compare that to the Mortality Rates for each  countries , regions, states.... the rates are very similar with a very small percentage margin of error. Death Rates are great use for TAG LINES! Brng to light the severity of Coronavirus on people with Diabetes is a moot point.   It's trying to elicit empathy for those who are apathetic.  Diabetes killed more people last year than COVID-19 will kill world wide when it is all said and done.  The thought that any one needs to make a case as to danger of COVID-19 to people  Diabetes shows how sad our society is. In 2019,"

This week the New Jersey-based Amneal Pharmaceuticals donated the drug hydroxychloroquine to the N.C.

Here's how we know.,"A persistent coronavirus myth that this virus, called SARS-CoV-2, was made by scientists and escaped from a lab in Wuhan is completely unfounded. Here's how we know. I still will observe and wait for more information.  The fact that Wuhan has a level 4 lab in place (known since the 80s) is still troubling imho.  Maybe they just had the virus intact as is and were studying it.  Seems coincidental to me.  But hey you guys are scientists, and you're always right.  And propaganda doesn't exist.  Stay calm sheep. Yeah it looks legit and it is good to see.  I'm almost ready to take the tinfoil off. 😁  However, is it not possible that it could still be engineered but made not to look engineered? This article is misleading. Most viruses held in labs are not genetically engineered and originate from natural sources. Just because this virus isn’t genetically modified does not mean the pandemic did not originate from a lab accident. I doubt we’ll ever know the truth, but the fact is, an accidental release from a lab is still plausible especially given the poor laboratory practices in China, notably selling carcasses of lab animals for consumption (!!!). People simply do not want to believe this is possible, hence articles like this. Not exactly scientifically rigorous. Sarcasm?  I never said I was what you stated.  I did know of the lab in the 80s, we monitored it.  I merely stated a level-4 facility at the epicenter.  I didn't state it was engineered.  I stated it seems sketchy as heck scientists are wasting time trying to white knight for China, instead of working on a solution. I agree that this virus is/was not ""manufactured"", but the original report was that it had been isolated from animals, (specifically bats), and was one of several used in experiments on human subjects, and this was the means by which it ""escaped"".     The story is plausible, however I do not necessarily subscribe to it at this time.    Given human nature and China's record of secrecy, I doubt that the truth, (if it is even close to this), ever comes out. The author can't be sure that ""The coronavirus did not escape from a lab."" What if people got the virus from animal and research on it in lab then by some way it got out? The only thing we're certain is this virus is not ""made in lab"". The only people who could have ""known since the 80s"" were fortune-tellers and crystal-ball gazers.  The Wuhan Institute of Virology's . THis Chinse Virus is either man-made or escaped from the lab or both. So, all of a sudden a virus just manifested itself. Tell that to the dogs and if dogs heard you say that, they probably won't believe it. See the article at AT: Nobody said (except for wild conspiracy theorists) that the virus was in the lab. However: 1) the lab in Wuhan was working on such viruses, 2) lab workers have been caught previously selling experimental animals in the nearby “wet market” for spare cash,  including bats. 3) the Wuhan “wet market” was the epicenter of the disease, as far as we can tell. There is an alternative concept that I ran into this morning - a PhD who has been studying these viruses for many years has an alternative theory - was sidelined for her research etc... the video has a lot of starter footage but if you go forward you can get to the interview....  (not on Youtube !!!) The Chinese Virus as it should rightly be called is an experiment that went viral. Something somewhere went terribly wrong and some interested parties were aware of it and they are not telling. WASH YOUR HANDS Why did China delay notifying the world of the issue with COVID-19?  If they didn’t make it, were they conducting experimental modifications on SARS-2 Corona viruses.  Questions are numerous, and valid responses are small This article does not debunk anything. I would say its natural selection until proven otherwise for now, but clearly this article and study do not ""Debunk"" anything. Just another fake science news article of the day imho. The article doesn't ""Debunk"" anything. Clearly its another hype article. I'm gonna go with its natural selection until proven otherwise, but its clearly not proven to be natural selection or from a lab at this time. Another fake news article of the day. says: LiveScience adds this: One interpretation of these remarks is that the maker of a bioweapon would not choose a virus that could actually spread rapidly among people. That is not credible. A better interpretation of these claims is that a weaponmaker might choose the SARS-CoV-2 virus if s/he knew of its potential, but the maker would not know of its potential because computer models would suggest that it wouldn't work. That may be. But (a) these articles give us no information on the relevant computer models, nor on the authors' expertise or research into the development of such models, and (b) there is an assumption that a weaponmaker's knowledge would be limited to what s/he could learn from computer models. There is no discussion, here, of other sources of knowledge upon which a weaponmaker could draw (e.g., unpublished research; insightful hunches; the lab notes of one's former professor or colleague). The Scripps quote (above) seems to say that only natural selection could design a spike protein that was highly effective at binding to human cells. In this sense, the articles do not seem to explain why a lab would be incapable of developing such a design. They seem to rest upon assumptions about what a weaponmaker would do. There does not seem to be any suggestion that a researcher would be unable to design such a virus now, given today's knowledge about how it works. In this sense, the articles seem to contend that nobody knew what was possible until it actually happened. That is an assertion about historical fact. It can be tested by means of historical research. One might begin with an investigation of the Wuhan lab's facilities and records and interviews of relevant personnel. As the source of this virus, China should be expected to permit that investigation. Its unwillingness to do so does raise a question of whether it has something to hide. The Scripps article continues: This appears to acknowledge that a researcher may have found the virus ready-made in nature. There may be other such viruses in nature. They may never make the jump to humans without the assistance of a researcher who collects them and stores them in a lab. That may have happened at Wuhan. It seems obvious that an investigation of that lab, yielding signs of work on (or at least storage of) something like SARS-CoV-2, would help to resolve the question of which scenario was most likely. The Scripps article says that the research ""found no evidence that the virus was made in a laboratory or otherwise engineered."" That is not a statement that no such evidence can be found, nor that an investigation of the Wuhan lab would find nothing. Thus, the Scripps article does not seem to justify some of the language found in the LiveScience article. The latter appears to be politically biased. Consider, specifically, its description of the lab hypothesis as a ""persistent myth,"" and the ridicule of this ""myth"" as the ""escaped from evil lab theory."" Such language suggests a preconceived outcome -- that Jeanna Bryner, the writer, already knew what the truth was, and was simply waiting for the Scripps study to establish her prior convictions. That is not science. Contrary to the desires of non-science writers, science is often a matter of collecting evidence that appears to be persuasive, but that is subject to later reinterpretation in light of new information. Ridiculing and dismissing ideas that are not currently popular among one's friends seems like a good way to discourage real scientists from trying to learn things that might prove very useful in the future. LiveScience should discourage such prejudgment. The better approach would be to take a critical and thoughtful stance when reporting on such research -- to pause and reflect on what it says and, ideally, to find out (or at least be generally informed on) what persons of another viewpoint might say about it. There are also public health and national security dimensions. Until historical research has definitely ruled out any involvement by the Wuhan lab, concern for the lives of the world's peoples should push strongly for research seeking to establish what that lab may have been doing. It does remain possible that the virus came from the lab -- that, if it was not created there, at least it was stored there. Until convincing evidence rules out that obvious possibility, the world should be very worried about future threats posed by that and other similar labs around the world. LiveScience should not be striving to undermine the safety of humanity in order to score petty zingers at the expense of real or imagined tin-hat crackpots. On LSE article it starts with the title: "" ."" It is not very scientific to claim to know something when most of the facts about its origins are not known and, there are other eminent scientific people who say otherwise. I am inclined to go with the article than a whole bunch of people who""just can't believe"".  That is the stuff that conspiracies are made of.    It is one thing to not accept the proof given as not being enough, but to pedal something else with absolutely no proof or even a hint of actual evidence is even worse. Plausibility is simply not evidence. Actually, new, i.e., novel, viruses just manifest themselves quite often. ... and none of that proves anything at all, but sure does wet conspiracy nut cases whistles big time.  Still waiting for some hard evidence to rear its ugly head. The issue I see with this article is that it says it was not created and likely came from bats, but then failed to even address the 2015 experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus — one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — which triggered renewed debate over whether engineering lab variants of viruses with possible pandemic potential is worth the risks. by not addressing that 2015 article directly, this new article only adds to the conspiracies. What about this: Or the article in nature which came out in 2015 in Nature: Lab-made coronavirus related to SARS can infect human cells. We are aware that this story is being used as the basis for unverified theories that the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 was engineered. There is no evidence that this is true; scientists believe that an animal is the most likely source of the coronavirus. 12 November 2015 An experiment that created a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus — one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — has triggered renewed debate over whether engineering lab variants of viruses with possible pandemic potential is worth the risks. In an article published in on 9 November, scientists investigated a virus called SHC014, which is found in horseshoe bats in China. The researchers created a chimaeric virus, made up of a surface protein of SHC014 and the backbone of a SARS virus that had been adapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease. The chimaera infected human airway cells — proving that the surface protein of SHC014 has the necessary structure to bind to a key receptor on the cells and to infect them. It also caused disease in mice, but did not kill them. Although almost all coronaviruses isolated from bats have not been able to bind to the key human receptor, SHC014 is not the first that can do so. In 2013, researchers reported this ability for the first time in a different coronavirus isolated from the same bat population . The findings reinforce suspicions that bat coronaviruses capable of directly infecting humans (rather than first needing to evolve in an intermediate animal host) may be more common than previously thought, the researchers say. But other virologists question whether the information gleaned from the experiment justifies the potential risk. Although the extent of any risk is difficult to assess, Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, points out that the researchers have created a novel virus that “grows remarkably well” in human cells. “If the virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,” he says. The argument is essentially a rerun of the debate over whether to allow lab research that increases the virulence, ease of spread or host range of dangerous pathogens — what is known as ‘gain-of-function’ research. In October 2014, on the viruses that cause SARS, influenza and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, a deadly disease caused by a virus that sporadically jumps from camels to people). The latest study was already under way before the US moratorium began, and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) allowed it to proceed while it was under review by the agency, says Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a co-author of the study. The NIH eventually concluded that the work was not so risky as to fall under the moratorium, he says. But Wain-Hobson disapproves of the study because, he says, it provides little benefit, and reveals little about the risk that the wild SHC014 virus in bats poses to humans. Other experiments in the study show that the virus in wild bats would need to evolve to pose any threat to humans — a change that may never happen, although it cannot be ruled out. Baric and his team reconstructed the wild virus from its genome sequence and found that it grew poorly in human cell cultures and caused no significant disease in mice. “The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk,” agrees Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence expert at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Both Ebright and Wain-Hobson are long-standing critics of gain-of-function research. In their paper, the study authors also concede that funders may think twice about allowing such experiments in the future. ""Scientific review panels may deem similar studies building chimeric viruses based on circulating strains too risky to pursue,"" they write, adding that discussion is needed as to ""whether these types of chimeric virus studies warrant further investigation versus the inherent risks involved”. But Baric and others say the research did have benefits. The study findings “move this virus from a candidate emerging pathogen to a clear and present danger”, says Peter Daszak, who co-authored the 2013 paper. Daszak is president of the EcoHealth Alliance, an international network of scientists, headquartered in New York City, that samples viruses from animals and people in emerging-diseases hotspots across the globe. Studies testing hybrid viruses in human cell culture and animal models are limited in what they can say about the threat posed by a wild virus, Daszak agrees. But he argues that they can help indicate which pathogens should be prioritized for further research attention. Without the experiments, says Baric, the SHC014 virus would still be seen as not a threat. Previously, scientists had believed, on the basis of molecular modelling and other studies, that it should not be able to infect human cells. The latest work shows that the virus has already overcome critical barriers, such as being able to latch onto human receptors and efficiently infect human airway cells, he says. “I don't think you can ignore that.” He plans to do further studies with the virus in non-human primates, which may yield data more relevant to humans. Nature doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18787 I always prefer to use logic when trying to decipher the unknown in any case. I would just like to make a few points that are absolute. Just to state my position I am undecided on this it could be either way I don't know there simply isn't enough clear information yet to make any determination. #1 - If a virus where to be engineered with the intention of release we need to consider why such a virus would be released.  In this case there would likely one of two goals which would be minimal depopulation or maximal depopulation. #2 - There would be a number of criteria that would have to be met in order to have a good candidate for each of these two types. I will just lay out some points for a minimal mortality virus. - Mortality highest in oldest patients - Easily transmitted - Rapidly spreading - Stealthy -  Here is the most important attribute: The structure of the virus is built in a way that is indistinguishable from what would be expected to be seen in nature. The best I can compare this idea from experience comes from Doom mapping. There has been competitions whereby mappers are instructed to create a 90's style map. That is actually really hard to and do well but the winners do it in a way that their mistakes look genuine and that is very hard to do when knowingly making mistakes. If this was created purposefully the engineers did an absolute perfect job and would relish seeing this article while basking in success. Conspiracy theories aside I am undecided however in any case just like going to trial you are innocent until proven guilty this is natural until proven otherwise by logic and hard facts of course. Coronavirus was engineered Sorry but the article is wrong! wow. that channel does not help your stance it's a bullshiet conspiracy channel"

What are the habits of ths people that are catching the virus? Are they disregarding the hand washing, not touching face and social distancing? Or do people who do thise things still catch the virus? In the beginning of this, I was optimistic that we would stop it in its tracks by doing those things. I would like be confident that I'm not going to get it if I simply don't touch my face, wash my hands often and after being out in public,  and staying reasonably far away from people. Im beginning to have doubts about that. China started their quarantine on Jan. 23.  Number of cases reported per day started decreasing somewhere around Feb. 8.  Biggest problem with this virus is that 1 in 4 infected are asymptomatic (no symptoms).  be patient. New York went into A slowdown but that does help just not as much as doing what was told to us all by many different medical people. Their bars were still open so how closed down is that. Had they not played politics I have to think there would be A lot less problems there. Than again being the mayor of A city that numbers millions why were they not better prepared?  They will blame everyone else for sure because that is what the democrats do. Never the less this Corona virus is number 19 and one of its predecessors I believe is what we call the flu.

Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/coronavirus-food-transmission.1816/,Coronavirus Food Transmission,"Thinking about getting take-out, but am still confused by expert opinions. If touching one's face is a potential risk, then why wouldn't eating virus-contaminated food carry a risk? Virus on the face is risky because one could touch the virus-laden face and then touch (1) the eye; (2) nose or (3) mouth, which is what the experts guide. The means of infection presumably is through contact of the virus with the membranes across any of the above. I understand that the virus will not likely survive the stomach acid which is one key reason experts give in concluding that transmission through ingesting contaminated food is unlikely. But, how does one deposit the food straight into the stomach without passage through the mouth? If a carrier (who may even be asymptomatic) coughs, sneezes, or even just speaks or breaths (a risk based on the latest research out today) over the food, and I ingest it, is there really no or minimal risk? Should people then not worry about touching their mouths with virus-contaminated hands? Hey there! Live Science did a great article on this, which you can find here: I'm no expert, but I do live and breathe here in these forums and hang out at the confluence of a lot of news and information coming through on this stuff, and I've picked up a few things. So, first and foremost, when getting takeout or delivery, you want to reduce as much face-to-face as humanly possible. If you're having food delivered, set up a table or surface outside and have your food placed there.  (If you're US-side, be sure to tip well, it's rough right now). Bring the package inside - remove the packaging itself and dump the food (try not to touch it directly while your handling the packaging) onto a plate or container of your own. Put the packaging in the garbage, wash your hands thoroughly, and eat.  Experts have indicated that the virus doesn't do well on prepared hot food at all, so what you're looking to do is get the food onto your own safe serving items.  You're good to eat. If you're getting takeout, again, do your level best to limit the amount of face-to-face being done, and avoid touching hands or direct physical exchange. Use credit/debit instead of cash if you can, and consider applying hand sanitizer or a sanitizing wipe in-between using any point-of-sale terminal that others have touched.  Once you have your food, again, you want to treat the containers as though they are contaminated - discard what you can, particularly any parts that may have been directly touched. Wipe down what you can with sanitizer, an alcohol or disinfecting wipe.  Do your best.  Either wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before eating. Fortunately, the food itself isn't the issue, it's the containers and surfaces and the potential to transmit virus from those to your face (making a bee-line into your respiratory system that way) is the thing to look out for. Naturally, you'll also want to limit take-out as much as possible because it does involve more potential risk than cooking at home. In order of safest on down, I'd peg it to the following: Home Cooking > Delivery > Drive-Thru Pick-up Takeout > Walk-in Pick-up Takeout. Thank you. That is all good advice, and the care warranted with respect to direct person-to-person contact and food packaging is understood.  My key concern is how long the virus can survive on the surface of the food itself.  I know that people talk about survival periods of 3 hours in the air, 24 hours on porous surfaces, and several days on smooth and shiny surfaces.  But, what about food?  Burgers, burritos, subs, etc. For example, the buns and tortillas wraps for burritos etc do not usually come straight out of the ovens at virus-killing temperatures.  If the virus makes it way onto a bun that makes the hamburger, what is the risk when that is ingested within the hour? It's a respiratory virus - which means roughly that unless you're literally inhaling your food, you're gonna be okay.  The CDC, FDA, WHO, and other organizations have indicated that there is no evidence the disease has been or can be transmitted by food. If you're really super worried and want to kill the virus on any food you consume, you can pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Coronavirus doesn't multiply on food. You *could* get it if someone with Coronavirus sneezed on an apple, then touched the apple, then touched your face, but you're far, far more likely to get it if you're standing next to someone at the market where you're picking up fruit. Thanks again. I know I am still missing something.  I understand that it's primarily respiratory.  But, if inhaling / breathing the virus is the only means of transmission, why is touching one's face a risk? Is that because one is more likely to breath in the virus that is on one's face?  What about the warning against touching one's mouth? Purely a risk of then breathing in the virus once the virus is attached to one's mouth?  No risk of transmission through the membranes that line our mouth (and nose and eyes)?  That will also mean that, as an example, using utensils left over by an infected person will not risk transmission as long as one is not inhaling on the surface of the utensils or touching one's face after using them to eat.  I want to be convinced but am still a bit incredulous.  I actually did get the take-out.  I will be reheating everything, which will not taste nearly as good afterwards, but will afford the peace of mind. I think the reason experts have concluded no evidence that food is a path is because they have originally classified it a a respiratory virus. But now that the virus has been found in stools like a fecal-oral virus, I think the evidence that food is a path is now in. Covid-19 is certainly acting like a hybrid that can be contracted by either inhalation or ingestion. The best way to envision this, as put by some others, is to think of the virus as glitter that you just can't see. A few things get rid of the glitter - soap being the best option.  As it is a respiratory disease, it's looking to find its way to your lungs, but it can certainly get there other ways apart from being inhaled. The reason they offer that you shouldn't touch your face, is because your face has a lot of entry points that serve as opportunities for the virus to get in. Your nose foremost, but your eyes, your mouth, ears, and other surface entry points into your body that make for really easy pathways for the virus. The biggest reason for lack of concern about food is that your digestive system is going to kill the virus, and the virus doesn't grow or thrive on food. You would not want to use utensils an infected person had used, because in that case, you'd be touching them with your hands, and at some point your hands will end up on your face. If you want to be absolutely, completely 100%, there's a useful comprehensive guide over at Serious Eats that you can take a look at as well - 149 degrees looks to be the magic number. But also note that doing this is overkill - there is no substantial evidence that novel coronavirus has been transmitted via food. Could you link to that finding? Finding the virus in stool doesn't indicate that it had infected. Our digestive system is a pretty epic set of processes that passes a whole bunch of horrifying things without subjecting us to infection, thankfully.  The current understanding of Covid-19 is that it is spread through inhalation, and that's the standing knowledge unless there's been affirmed, verifiable updates. Found article below from the LANCET that explains modes of transmission through the body's mucous membranes.  This is contact, not inhalation.  So, the question remains - if virus lands on food and is ingested prior to the end of its survival period on food surface (however short it might be), then if the food is consumed (again, passage through the mouth and therefore the mucous membranes, as opposed to depositing straight into the stomach protected by stomach acid), is there no risk of infection?  I read it as carrying a potential risk. Chaolin Huang and colleagues reported the epidemiology, symptoms, and treatment of patients infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China. As ophthalmologists, we believe that transmission of 2019-nCoV through the eyes was ignored. On Jan 22, Guangfa Wang, a member of the national expert panel on pneumonia, reported that he was infected by 2019-nCoV during the inspection in Wuhan. He wore an N95 mask but did not wear anything to protect his eyes. Several days before the onset of pneumonia, Wang complained of redness of the eyes. Unprotected exposure of the eyes to 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan Fever Clinic might have allowed the virus to infect the body. • Infectious droplets and body fluids can easily contaminate the human conjunctival epithelium. Respiratory viruses are capable of inducing ocular complications in infected patients, which then leads to respiratory infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is predominantly transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth, or nose. The fact that exposed mucous membranes and unprotected eyes increased the risk of SARS-CoV transmission suggests that exposure of unprotected eyes to 2019-nCoV could cause acute respiratory infection. Thus, Huang and colleagues should have analysed conjunctival scrapings from both confirmed and suspected 2019-nCoV cases during the onset of symptoms. The respiratory tract is probably not the only transmission route for 2019-nCoV, and all ophthalmologists examining suspected cases should wear protective eyewear. Link is . True there is no way the Covid virus found in stool was the one ingested. It would have been produced in the body and shed to the stool in the bowel like a gastrointestinal virus does, ie. Norwalk virus or stomach flu.  If we Google Norwalk Virus transmission paths, this pops up: If Covid-19 was a true respiratory virus like regular flu, I do not believe it would be found in stools of infected patients, but would be open to evidence otherwise. Course this paper indicates real threat of this virus is sever acute lung infections associated with direct inhalation of the virus. Case severity associated with indirect transmission such as food ingestion tends to lead to milder cases and better infection outcomes. So if you are of view that sooner or later we are all going to get this virus one way the other, food ingestion may not be the big deal I thought it was. Exactly - it's the respiratory aspect that's the potential killer here.  And it's also why the CDC is now recommending donning a mask if you have to go out for supplies.  Inhalation through droplet spread or contact with hands (that then end up on the face/nose) and subsequent inhalation appears to be the primary vector and transmission method.  Fortunately, much, much less of a worry with food. Thanks!   Transmission via food is possible, but severity is much less. That makes sense."

Chlorine gas is very dangerous and should not be used at all. First of all it is known that inhaling chlorine gas is dangerous. You are 100% right about that.  Not much good killing the virus if the patient dies from gas.  Chlorine smell from swimming pool is insignificant exposure. Much more likely that your swimming friend was lucky enough to get a mild case and that his quick recovery had absolutely nothing to do with smelling swimming pool chorine. However, if he got Covid during time he was working on pools, obvious observation would be that his exposure did not stop him from getting it. Chlorine gas is very toxic. It reacts with the moisture on your skin and interior mucus lining, making HCL acid.  Your lungs will tear and cry like never before, and can drown you.  It burns everything of your body.  In and out. My cousin's grandfather was gased with chlorine in the trenches of WWI. I think we agree clhorine gas bad for people, but there is also emerging evidence that when the virus is inhaled and begins by infecting our lungs, it quickly affects our ability to absorb oxygen is very bad. Because the virus is inside our lungs and not in our bloodstreams our immune systems do not recognize it quickly and are very limited in response since the virus in our lungs is essentially out of reach of the antibodies in our blood that our immune systems would normally create to combat the virus. So I can understand the ideal of trying to find a way directly treat the virus. Patients developing acute respiratory syndrome will typically be given oxygen and then put on ventilators when oxygen alone is not sufficient to counter the deteriorating lung condition.  Antibiotic mists that are sometimes used for bacterial infections of course don't work for viruses. Rather than chlorine gas, we know that hydrogen peroxide is an effective  covid virus disinfectant that is much more human freindly than chlorine. So curious if a dilute hydrogen peroxide mist were delivered to lungs through a nebulizer or similar, if it might have the potential to sufficiently knock back the virus that the body's natural defence mechanisms might have the chance to come into effect before the patient expires? Interested to hear if anyone may have had any knowledge of something like this ever being tried and what the results might have been?"

The face-covering mask can be fashioned from simple household items such as a clean T-shirt or cloth, as demonstrated in CDC's do-it-yourself guide. Because surgical face masks and other personal protective equipment are in short supply in the health care arena across the United States, the CDC advises that homemade cloth face coverings should: CDC officials say cloth face coverings are especially critical in areas of significant community-based transmission. Using a simple cloth face covering not only can slow the spread of COVID-19, but also can help those who could unknowingly have the virus from spreading it to others, the CDC said. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than age 2, on anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance, the CDC advises. Cloth face coverings should be washed routinely in a washing machine, CDC authorities said. When removing a used face cloth covering, the CDC says people should use caution and not touch their eyes, nose or mouth, and immediately wash their hands after taking the covering off. The CDC emphasizes that its recommendation on face cloth coverings complements, and does not replace, the President's Coronavirus Guidelines for America, 30 Days to Slow the Spread, which remains the cornerstone of the national effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Anthrax, an already existing dsease, is much deadlier and can live outside people for very long. This is no attack, just a virus that mutated to be better at infecting us than others. Natural selection drives this, not some terrorst group."
Coronavirus,https://forums.livescience.com/threads/can-grand-kids-visit-if-they-and-parents-have-had-coronavirus.1802/,Can Grand Kids Visit if They and Parents have had Coronavirus,"I believe my grandsons and their parents had coronavirus 2 weeks ago and they have resolved.  If we can   confirm that fact can the grand kids visit my wife and I so we can help home school them? We had similar questions and the response we got was unless they were tested for covid-19 and it was positive  there is no way to be sure that they actually had it.  They would have to be tested again to make sure there are no longer positive and then should stay away for at least 14 days since the last sign of symptoms before seeing them.  If they were not tested then you cannot be sure that your family has had it.  My husband and I both think we had it but that was before the test was available   Our daughter has a dangerous lung problem and we can not take a chance of her getting sick.  She almost died while on a respirator the last time and for her to get the virus would probably be deadly.  Try using Zoom to help the kids with their school work, they will probably think it is fun..  God Bless and good luck. The real question here is this: Suppose a person has been tested positive for covid-19.  Then they have gone through the symptoms, recovered, and been tested again (actually twice, 24 hours apart, just to be sure), and found to be truly recovered and clear. Is there any good reason that person needs to hunker down and wear a mask and gloves and go through all the social distancing everyone else still needs to do? There was a study done which I read a couple weeks ago, very preliminary, not even peer reviewed yet (as made available on the net they were quite clear about these details), but results seemed quite clear that the proteins of the virus were positively identified in the mucous and sputum of the person, but nothing of any of it could be made to breed or grow, I.e., the virus is killed. Their antibodies kill it. Unfortunately I have been utterly unable to find any follow up, no further experiments of this kind, not even that promised peer review, nothing. Apparently, no other scientists, research grants, or whatever, seem the least bit concerned with that truly great and most relevant question. As of three weeks ago today (March 12), 6,839 persons had tested positive for this disease all around the world. Since the disease normally runs its course in two weeks, only three at the extreme outside, allowing for that fraction (~1%?) who have died, and what roughly similarly sized fraction may still be suffering from it (or far more likely by now, not so much from the disease itself but rather from complications that followed from it), and most people recover in about two weeks (March 19) by which 30,462 persons worldwide had tested positive, that means that somewhere between 6,000 and 30,000 persons (to say nothing of how many further cases were never officially diagnosed but did, though they remain to be verified) are already both safe and harmless; they cannot get it, and they are not contagious. Such results would be of great significance most directly to that small but ever-growing group of those who have recovered and are therefore truly fully immune. These results are also of interest to the rest of us, as we see in them the beginning of our much desired return to normalcy. These folks really can and should return to their jobs (or better, serve as volunteers to help), and as their numbers increase (exponentially, at least until about two to three weeks after the spread of the disease stops increasing exponentially), they are the living symbols of what will be, once we are all safely inoculated with some vaccine for this. We have good reason to believe that this will be the case, though of course more testing is needed, both of individuals so as to know for certain that they are truly immune, and further verifications of that one preliminary study, before we could unconditionally recommend such visitations, but hopefully someone will begin to lean on our scientific community to answer that question. And then the yet bigger question: once so immune and safe, how long will our bodies continue to make the necessary antibodies? six months? a year? several years? the rest of our lives? Our earliest complete recoveries will be the best early indicators of the answer to that question. Maybe err on the side of caution until we know for sure if those who recover have immunity."

COVID-19, like other viruses, is best fought with a strong immune system. In fact, the stronger the better. If we get our hands on an effective vaccine, the benefit of it will be giving our immune systems the tools to combat the illness. Immunosuppresants work to weaken the immune system. They benefit a very specific group of people with very specific medical conditions, but will make things substantially worse for anyone trying to fight a viral infection like coronavirus. If you have a specific concern about a specific medication, be sure to speak with a medical doctor, but as a general question, that info, I hope, is helpful. Thanks for your reply. However, I thought that the majority of disease from covid was from the immune system itself? Hello, Would the virus be affected,by helium?if you could  breathe it into your lungs ?  the virus may not like that different enviroment in the lungs thanks Helium is an so called ""Edelgas"". It will not react with other substances. Therefore it was used in Luftschiffen and balloons... If you breathe it nothing will happen, only your voice changes... but if you sniff on gasoline vapour only ones all your viruses are destroyed in a second. Don't breath longer as one second! I live for over 30 years now absolute virus-free in this way. (""virus-free"" means the sort of viruses attacking humans) It seems only impossible to get this message to the public. My intention is only to save lives."

Too much soap make my hands dry and cracks skin. A lot will depend on what you do with your hands for a living.  Are you an automobile mechanic?  Drywall?  An office worker?  Garbage collector?  Nurse? I'll bet you could brush your hands in a bowl of 3% hydrogen peroxide, brushing the complete area with an appropriate duration.  Don't rinse in water.  Leave brush in bowl. One cloth drying towel will last you all day.  Assuming pen and paper work. It should promote hand crack healing.   Let us know. I'm retired, so no problems there. I' not going to be paranoid over this virus, so, I think I'll just keep using only water. At one time - 10 years ago - my hands used to crack so badly, they used to bleed. One day I put some warmer clothes on and turned the heating down a lot. That cured the problem overnight, it must have been the dry air causing the problem. Many thanks for your reply Water alone is better than not washing, absolutely. There are also a number of hand sanitizers out there that will not dry out or your skin as much as most soaps. I hope you find a solution that works well for you. Thanks, but I was wondering, specifically, if heat is enough to destroy germs, since I think milk is pasteurised at 60'C, and my dishwasher is also 60'C. Not having a thermometer, I don't know what the maximum temperature I could tolerate is, but I guess 55 or 60. I suspect if it was good enough we would have been told. Many thanks for your reply We can sense changes in vision and hearing pretty quick.  But sensing temperature change by touch requires a duration.  We define ""hot"" to touch with this duration. I would NOT try rinsing my hands for 20 seconds with 140 F water. Some say 2 sec at 140 and some say 5 sec of 140 without skin damage.  Hotter that that needs to be protected from touch. A guard or insulation required.  At 140 and lower, one has enough time to remove hand safely before damage.  Bare pipe."

I realize that CPB pumps were designed to supply oxygen and pump blood when a patient's heart is not functioning, such as during cardiac surgery. But could the pump also be used to supply oxygen during the period of time that a Covid-19 patient's lungs aren't functioning adequately? I don't think so CPB pump can be used for COVID-19 patients. Doctors are using ventilators to help patients in breathing. Thanks for your reply Albertina. Ventilators are being used to help patients breathe. But when Covid-19 patients die it is usually because even with a ventilator they are unable to get enough oxygen. The CPB pump is a way of getting oxygen without using the lungs. Since my original post I've learned that there are problems using CPB pumps for more than maybe a day or two at the most. However there is another similar device called an ECMO that can be used for periods of 3 to 10 days ( ).  Here's an article about the use of an ECMO devices to try to save critically ill Covid-19 patients: Per the article, whether and when to use these devices for Covid-19 patients are complicated questions."
