Oddly enough, between my friends, colleagues, neighbors and family who are on a statin drug, did NOT catch Covid, to include my brother who was in a household with folk who had Covid!  Per the report, since Covid causes severe inflammation in our body due to the virus attaching itself and attack our blood, the statin is preventing Covid from going rampant and attacking our blood cells.

It’s been so helpful seeing that it’s not just me still dealing with issues after Covid. I tested positive on December 31 of last year. My struggles have been with fatigue (like everyone else), low blood pressure, inner ear pressure & motion sickness. I was on antibiotics & nasal sprays for the ear pressure which were no help. Finally decided to try vestibular physical therapy. My therapist was amazing. While it didn’t relieve the ear pressure, she helped me be able to ride in a car longer than 5 minutes without feeling nauseated. My ear issue was not vertigo. It’s so hard getting others to understand that. The pressure worsens the more fatigued I am experiencing. It’s also makes my hearing worse. Doctors are at a loss as how to help. Fatigue is a battle. I’ll feel fine and participate in some type of activity then suffer for a couple of days with fatigue. I try to listen to my body & not overdue but . . . it’s hard. My husband & I retired shortly before I got Covid.  We’d like to do activities. I try but suffer afterwards. Fatigue is a beast. People don’t understand that while I may look & sound fine, fatigue is my constant companion. I do walk each morning which I need to do for my mental well being. I lost some weight. It’s slowly coming back. Had a stretch where I had low blood pressure. It was in the 80/50 range. It’s come back up most days to a more normal level. My doctor lowered the beta blocker I was on for migraines. You can imagine what has happened since. Yes, my migraines are slowly coming back. Yuk! My PCP referred me to the University of Florida’s long Covid treatment program. Earliest appointment I could get is mid September. One day at a time. Such an awful experience!!  "

My Meds doc at the TMS and mental health center wants me to see primary care doctor to rule out other issues. 
He has switched me from viibryd to 200 mg of luvox at bed time for ocd ( ruminating thoughts)…I still take Klonopin 0.5mg at night and as needed otherwise for anxiety. 
My anxiety can come up at anytime for no reason and no triggers. 
He thinks i may have long covid and says he sees a couple long covid patients. 
My question is…How do i approach my primary care doctor besides telling him the obvious? 
If all my bloodwork and tests come back fine…Then what?

I'm a mid-40s male in good health (or was). I contracted COVID in Oct 2020 and never recovered from it. I had what they called a ""mild"" case where my blood oxygen level didn't drop below 90% and I wasn't hospitalized. I had a fever for about two weeks, migraines, and numerous varying symptoms over that period of isolation. Once I finally got out of isolation, I still encountered heavy fatigue, muscle weakness, and heavy inflammation. I teach computer science and cybersecurity at a small university and consult on the side. I was missing 2-3 days of class a week due to an inability to function well enough to lecture. I was sent to the ER twice, once due to possible stroke and again for a kidney stone (never had one before in my life). I was vaccinated in the Spring of 2021 because the stories of it improving Long COVID suffering, it didn't. A couple months later in June, I started to relapse badly, and have been slowly declining since. I had to withdraw from my doctorate program because I was unable to keep up with the work as I struggle to keep a thought for more than a couple minutes. This is also impacting lesson planning, lecturing, consulting, etc.  Currently, I am struggling to move very far physically. I try to walk for 20 min a couple times a week, but it takes 2-3 days to recover from it. My body is constantly in pain from the inflammation (6 or 7 on a scale of 1-10), with spikes from time to time. I struggle to walk, type, or perform many activities. High temperatures amplify the pain and weakness, so this summer has been far from relaxing. I've had to use a cane to walk, but my grip and arm strength is not good, so it's not much of a benefit. I'm used to working 8-10hrs a day and right now am lucky to get 2-4hrs in a day. I'm the sole source of income for my family so I can't just stop and rest until better. I've been visiting the Vanderbilt Adult Post-Acute COVID clinic for over a year now. We've tried many different treatments, mostly wholistic focused, but with minimal success. All the treatments that have worked for other patients in the program have not shown noticeable improvements for me. I'm running out of ideas for things to try. I have to resume teaching in a month and I'm not sure how I'm going to survive the semester in my current state.  I'm on a base set of a good pro-biotic, Vit B complex, Vit C, Vit D, baby aspirin, one or two other supplements.  I've tried PEA supplements, NMN supplements, Cortisol managers, and others. We tried a common steroid to try and alleviate some of the pain from inflammation, but it didn't prove any benefit, only major side effects. Any ideas of things that may help are welcome. "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ayurveda/,Ayurveda ,"Hello everyone. So I had covid three times last year, possibly four but one time was negative test. I developed severe acid reflux ( I have hashimotos which can also cause reflux and can also be triggered by EBV, and while I’ve had reflux it got much worse after covid) 
I suspected I had SIBO and my doctor was willing to give me a two week trial of cipro. Because I also suspected the possibility of h pylori I took a dose of pepto bismol daily in addition to pre and probiotics. 
This helped significantly with my reflux though I still had some minor issues. 
I still suffered from extreme fatigue and muscle weakness, which is common with hashimotos but much worse after covid. 
I decided to look into some Ayurvedic medicine and a week ago started ashwagandha and black seed oil. Both have amazing benefits and there’s a link between Long Covid and EBV, and EBV is considered a factor in hashimotos too. 
I also added Maca and oil of oregano. Oil of oregano can help with EBV as well. Black seed oil has been shown to help with h pylori as well. 
Since starting these my fatigue is greatly improved. My reflux is practically gone and I’m actually able to do squats ( two years ago I could do 300 squats a day but since Covid started ( I thought I had covid back in 2020 but negative tests) I couldn’t do ten squats without feeling like my legs would fall off. Yesterday I did over 100 where a week ago couldn’t.  These might be good options. There are a lot of benefits to black seed oil ( nigella sativa) and oil of oregano as well as ashwagandha. 
I haven’t felt this good in a long time. 
Black seed oil and oil of oregano both can help with EBV and also blastocystis hominis ( another suspect in hashimotos).  Hopefully this helps someone  "

(A Pulmonologist prescribed for me .)The symptoms are easy flare up if I caught a cold or stressful with my life.  My Plethysmography Report shows FEV1/FVC was 0.81. The doctor said not normal but not too bad. Last week, I went to a POST COVID program and the doctor there gave me Trelegy 200. Has anyone ever tried this one with Shortness of Breath? I feel it is too strong especially I haven't used a higher dose Symbicort yet. If I use Trelegy which is the highest level inhaler for Asthma, what can I use if the symptom get worse down the road? "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/waited-6-months-to-go-to-long-hauler-covid-clinic-and-very-disappointe/,How did a Long Hauler COVID Clinic help you?,"Well I waited over 6 months to go to a long hauler covid clinic in Central Florida and I'm very disappointed after my first and only appointment with this doctor. I read so many reviews that she was working diligently and I'm sure she is with long hauler patients so I made an appointment since I've been sick for 2.5 years with many neurological and sensory and cardio and autonomic nervous system symptoms that are debilitating for 2.5 years now. Well my first appointment after waiting 6 months was this past week. I told her that my husband and I both became deathly ill in late November 2019 along with many other people not only in America but around the world who became deathly ill with symptoms that absolutely 100% mimic covid yet the doctors at that time were not aware of it so they label it as a unknown upper respiratory virus. I was tested for the flu and pneumonia and it was all negative at that time but I could hardly breathe and had to go on albuterol and I had severe fatigue and brain fog and fever and dry hacking cough that lasted 2 months yet since there was no covid test at that time I was just labeled as having an upper respiratory virus of unknown origins and the same for my husband. I explained all this to her and told her since that virus which I believe was covid and if you read reviews from around the world many many people were deathly ill in November and December of 2019 and many of us fully believe 100% it was covid. Yet the world was only told about this virus in January of 2020 only one and a half months after many of us became very very ill. The doctor told me that it could not have been covid in late November 2019 because the first diagnosed patient in America was in I believe she said either December 2019 or early January 2020. I don't understand this just because a patient in America was the supposedly the first one diagnosed with covid in either December 2019 or January 2020 that that would exclude everybody else that was deathly ill one or two weeks prior to that supposed first diagnosed covid patient in America. So basically after I gave her all of my debilitating symptoms which is kept me from even holding down a job for 2.5 years and I've been chronically sick and in bed a lot of times not able to function and my quality of life has gone to dirt she dismissed all of the symptoms and told me that they basically could not be from covid because of course as mentioned the first diagnosed covid patient in America was not until about 2 weeks or 3 weeks after my husband and I were deathly sick and Augusta Georgia. So after waiting 6 months thinking I had some hope that a doctor would dig into this matter because I truly 100% believe as time passes by many of the doctors will have to awaken to the fact and the truth that covid was circulating way before January 2020. In fact many of the people who have come forward in China said that the virus was circulating in the summer of 2019 into the fall of 2019 and with the massive travel around the world people coming in and out of America thousands and thousands by the day from China there's no doubt in my mind my husband and I had covid yet not one doctor will recognize that and try to help me. Therefore with hitting roadblock after roadblock after roadblock with doctors basically shutting off their ears to watch so many patients are telling them I am just washing my hands of it all. I will go to my grave being deathly ill fully knowing that all these neurologists and cardiologist and endocrinologist and primary care doctors have their nose firmly adhere to the wall and will not acknowledge or research or try to help patients that have never recovered and have heart issues or breathing issues or severe chronic fatigue or neurological autonomic nervous system malfunctioning etc and just because this supposed patient in America for the first patient in America that was diagnosed with covid was several weeks after my husband and I were sick yet the flu test was negative and pneumonia was negative so the doctors back then just diagnosed us as undetermined upper respiratory virus and I had to be put on albuterol and spiriva just to breathe when I've never had breathing problems and I've had many flu bugs in my day I'm 62 years old and I've had many many many cold viruses and flu viruses and I've never ever ever had those severe debilitating symptoms. So once again I've been brushed to the side and was told last week that since my second covid diagnosis in March where I was tested for covid and it was positive and I had to have a monoclonal infusion that with that test showing covid in March of 2022 which I had the same exact symptoms in March 2022 as I had in November 2019 that she had to go by the March 2022 symptoms which showed nothing new except for more fatigue so that was the only symptoms she would work off of and she told me I should be gaining my strength and feeling better in a short time. She would not listen that I've been chronically fatigued for 2.5 years since the initial November 2019 virus. So I was sent on my way out the door with not even a follow-up appointment I am washing my hands completely with all these doctors in America. This is absolutely disgraceful but you know what the truth will be told and I may not be alive to see it or hear it but the truth will be told that so many of us patients from around the world, not just America, who got a severe virus in the end of 2019 that we actually did have covid yet none of the doctors are willing to recognize that and try to help us. And of course it's brushed off as anxiety and stress and go on an antidepressant go on an anti-anxiety medicine go see a psychiatrist etc and I'm fed up with hearing that too. "

The doctor tells me she has seen other Covid-19 patients and some of they say they cannot sleep. Just wondering is anyone experiencing insomnia as a direct symptom of Covid-19?

I am vaxxed to the max (5 shots all together, last booster was in November 2022), and I know that is no guarantee you won’t get COVID, but I was disappointed that it finally caught me. I had so many friends get it and had been exposed but never got it so I was feeling confident (cocky?) I would never get it. 
I am 64 and in good health, teach an exercise class and eat a fairly healthy diet. 
I guess I’m considered high risk by age, so my doc got me right on Paxlovid that evening that I was diagnosed. I was hopeful I would have a minor case and go right back to work in 5 days. That was 10 days ago. 
While most symptoms have improved (cough is almost gone, no more high fever, small spurts of energy) I have a few persistent symptoms that are keeping me home from work. I still have a stuffy nose, fatigue, and can’t seem to go 24 hours without a low-grade fever (a requirement for me to return to work). 
I feel very unproductive and frustrated. I love my job and want to return to work, but I fear this lingering fever could keep me home a lot longer. 
I followed advice given to me by HR and (reluctantly) filed for protection under FMLA. Now I’m glad I did because I never expected to be out of work for more than a week. 
I can do some work from home, but I work in a public facility and need to be there to fully do my job.

Meaning you always feel scared for no reason and it leads to anxiety attacks sometimes 
Like your just waiting for the worst to happen and no longer do things you used to…Like go out to eat…Go shopping etc etc. 
I know my anxiety started after covid and never had a panic attack in my life before getting it. 
Even when i am not having a attack the fear is still there. 
Does anybody relate to my situation?

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/difficulty-driving-after-covid-19/,Difficulty Driving After COVID-19,"In 2021, I drove for miles on the highways for additional income using Lyft, GoPuff and GrubHub to provide extra cash for my family. January 2022, I tested positive for COVID-19 along with my family. I knew I shouldn't be driving while I was sick but I decided to drive to get essential medicine next door. As I was driving out of my apartment complex to go to the store I had a painful squeezing sensation in my left leg which traveled to my arm and chest. I thought I was dying so I stopped and I tried going to Urgent Care but I couldn't drive any further. I went home and waited even though I should of went to the Emergency Room. During my battle with COVID at home I would have episodes where I had difficulty breathing, fatigue, brain fog, fever, light headed, chest pain, nightmares at night and some loss of taste. COVID was the worst sickness I had experienced in my life. After I tested negative a lot of the symptoms went away but I still had difficulty breathing, palpitations and I couldn't drive for even 2 miles. I eventually went to the emergency room in February 2022 and learned my D Dimer was high but no blood clots in chest, lungs and a normal EKG. June 2022, I had a Pulmonary Function Test and learned I had intermittent asthma after my COVID-19 infection. I checked my heart as well with my cardiologist and all my tests were normal including a stress test. Fast forward to now, I still have trouble driving but it's not as terrible. There are some days I can drive for 2 hours and others only minutes. I can't find any patterns other than my symptoms are worst when I drive on the highway. I get shortness of breathe, tingling in my hands along with feet, squeezing in my legs, squeezing in arms, light headed, feeling of fainting and chest pain. I was told it's just anxiety and I've been to the ER many times but these symptoms are very real and terrifying. I thought I could overcome this and took a job as a Field Technician but I was fired because I had an episode on the highway where I had to go to Urgent Care. This is ruining my life because as of lately my recent job offers involve a lot of driving and I struggle to drive. It's extremely difficult to get a remote job as it's extremely competitive. I'm hoping for a desktop tech job nearby so I don't have to drive too far. I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced the same issues with driving after COVID-19? What did you find and how you've over came it? "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/exacerbated-anxiety-and-depression-brain-fog-long-covid/,"Exacerbated anxiety and depression, brain fog: Long Covid","Good evening.  New here on the board and I imagine what I'm about to write may have been discussed.  I did a little searching already but hope to get some direct feedback.  My life for the last several months has been turned upside down.  Everything was ""manageable"" until post-Covid.  There are no other explanations as to why I've been feeling this way, yet my primary physician, among others, refuse to say I have Long Covid. 
It was early August when I tested positive, and recovered from the typical symptoms about a week later.   In early November is when everything started going downhill.  The most noticeable symptom was brain fog.  I felt/feel like I can't concentrate, lose focus, slur speech on occasion, zone out, etc.  Fatigue was also setting in which is when I contacted my doctor.  We decided that it may have been time to adjust my meds.  I was on 30mg of Cymbalta and increased to 40mg daily.  After Thanksgiving and into December, the feelings were a bit overwhelming and we pinned it on the increased mgs.  Nobody had even mentioned Covid at the time.  I believe I eventually brought it up, by the way. 
By the time January rolled around, nothing was changing.  I had believed that now I was suffering from Cymbalta withdrawal and it was just a matter of time before it dissipated.  Klonopin daily helped but things were still the same when I didnt have one in my system.  I restarted Cymbalta, just 20mg daily, to combat withdrawal, then decided to try Effexor.  Its been 2 weeks and I'm on the lowest dosage.  I wrote my psychiatrist asking to increase since I feel like things are getting worse.  In addition to those symptoms I felt earlier, I cry several times a day, agoraphobic, barely move around the house, all while trying to be a good dad to an 8 year old boy.  My primary had nothing to say other than ""I know it's upsetting but keep doing your best!"". 
It may not even matter what the cause is, but is it safe to say it's Long Covid?  It will/does feel like validation, that I didn't do anything wrong to start feeling this way, that is was this awful disease that's still lurking inside of me causing these reactions. 
If so, what have we learned thus far as to how to treat it?  Has anyone felt similarly?  I'll be on Effexor and Klonopin daily, all the advised supplements, allergy meds, and Pepcid AC for my constant upset stomach.  Any other recommedations?  Does anyone have any experience with Effexor?  Cymbalta wasn't all that bad for about two years but the recommedation was to switch even though they're quite similar. 
Thanks in advance for anything at all and best of luck to anyone suffering.  I truly wouldn't wish anything like this on my worst enemy. "
Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/diagnosed-a-while-ago-with-pots-but-my-bp/,Diagnosed a while ago with POTS but my BP... ,"I was diagnosed with POTS about 8 months ago when at my PCPs, I was dizzy and my face went numb. 180/120.  A quick dose of clonidine brought it down. She didn't put me on any high blood pressure medication, so as an RN, I bought a cuff and started taking it myself. It stayed under whaterever/100 so I just sat on it till I went thru a dizzy spelled again and it was through the roof. I was put on losartan about 6 weeks ago once/day. Within 2 weeks I was on twice a day as it wasn't helping. AM and PM but in the middle of the day it would be really high again, so I was put on clonidine twice a day PRN. And that's where I am right now except it's still really high.  After sitting in my chair for hours yesterday basically doing nothing, it was 180/104 when I went to bed. When I'm taking my evening dose I never know whether to take a PRN at the same time, but I figure it needs to come down fast and if I'm in bed it doesn't matter if my blood pressure a little bit crashes. I'm really quite concerned but I seem to be the only one. ""Take your blood pressure twice a day, write it down, and I'll see you in 6 weeks."" and my PCP (who is an RNP, is actually quite well versed in Long Covid but probably frustrated as there's nothing she can do? So I do a lot of my own research. I just saw a video on YouTube by Dr Mark Hyman about about inflammation and long covid. It's worth watching.  If you do a search on his name  you'll find that video.  It's about an hour long but he mentions a few blood tests that can be done to check for things that aren't being checked for enough. Has to do with small blood clots and inflammation in the veins and arteries. I'm going to check with my PCP when I see her on Wednesday and see if I can get her to order these blood tests and see what's up. Don't we all get tired of everything coming back negative! I get to the doctor in my O2 and my blood pressure fine so I'm glad my blood pressure cuff keeps the reading in memory. I even bought a pulsox that comes with an app so it can be monitored on my phone. It's also worth saying that I've been on overnight oxygen for a 3 years now and I just had to start using oxygen prn during the day. It's not unusual for my oxygen to be in the 80s. I feel like I'm the only one concerned and I feel like long covid is eventually going to kill me. They say POTS  won't kill you but a stroke will. Or if the POTS you have is low blood pressure, if you faint and hit your head,  that will kill you too. I wish people were spending as much money on helping us as they spend ""getting back to normal and opening everything back up"" pretending covid no longer exists. (there's another new variant they're tracking.) I had a really mild case in July of 2020. And I've been sick ever since. I feel like even my friends don't think it's possibly that big a deal. Tired of hearing about it. I feel like my fear of death is real and I'm the only one who's afraid. I'm scared. Is anybody else? I feel like with covid there's three groups. Those who lived, those who died, and those who wish they died? (I am glad to be alive, I'm really afraid to die this way.) I probably should add my mother died of covid in February 2020 before they say it was even here. I know lots of people who say they were very sick in January and February 2020, like ""the sickest they'd ever been in your life.""  I hear people now who say ""I've got the worst cold I've ever had."" I ask if they've tested and they say they are negative. My PCP told me anybody who says ""worst of anything,"" it's covid. I'll add I've had it twice and I've never tested positive. I also have CRPS which is an autoimmune pain disorder and had a huge spread throughout my body as my cytokine level is already naturally elevated. The only thing I keep telling myself is at least I'm 68 and I'm not 35, confined to bed, needing to be carried to the bathroom. I'm seeing people that were very very healthy now being very very sick on the long covid Facebook group. I'm probably depressed as I probably always am but… Medicare won't pay for help in the home unless you need somebody to bathe you. Leave me some dignity huh?  And if you can leave the house and drive to the doctors, then you don't qualify for home assistance. I also go to physical therapy twice a week and very very fortunate to have good insurance. For me, sometimes I've been sleeping on the same sheets for 4 or 6 months. Usually a sink full of dishes and a huge pile of dirty clothes. Kitchen and bathroom floors that have not been washed in a couple years. Life is hard. I'm single, my closest family member 1000 miles away. Even they don't think anything could possibly be serious. They had covid and they are fine. Thanks for listening. I'm feeling very frustrated and very scared right now. And very alone. Keep myself occupied as I actually still run a small graphic design business out of my house.  I'm working on some KDP (Amazon) low content books to sell (coloring books, journals, kids maze books, etc.) If you know computers and looking for something to keep you busy, check YouTube. There's lots of videos about KDP self-publishing. At least it keeps me busy. My best, Betty  "

The neurologist finally diagnosed complex migraine with aura.  I am 66 years old and had one more typical migraine when I was 20, and nothing since then.  Since that first episode, I have had four more, and each has varied slightly in nature but all have been quite disturbing in that I often have a period where I slur my words, and then the actual migraine is followed by 2-7 days of brain fog that is distressing.  My Mayo neurologist did not suggest any medication, but I did connect with a local neurologist who suggested I try Nurtec, which is taken at the first symptom and can work for my type of migraine.  Medicare does not pay for it.  I broke down and bought an 8-pack, at $100/pill, and keep one with me always.  Since getting the med, I did have one migraine but it was the middle of the night and I was so out of it that I didn't think to take the pill until I was well into the episode.   The pulmonologist did determine that I had had covid, due to signs he saw on my lung CT.  I have come to the conclusion that my sudden onset of migraine is connected to the covid.

My husband was initially infected with COVID in March 2020.  He spent the next 9-mo in bed 18-hours a day.  We “followed the symptoms” which led us to see a cardiologist.  My husband ended up having a quadruple bypass/graft (CABG) at the age of 52 in February 2021.  His sternum, however, never healed back together.  He followed doctors orders, yet months after surgery, he was in continuous pain.  Nine months after surgery, he had a CT scan that showed, an unstable, non-union of his sternum with at least 3 broken wires.   His sternum was separated by almost a centimeter!  One side was also projected out further than the other.  He was a mess.  He was told not to drive, not to hold anything heavier than a gallon of milk.  With the instability of his sternum and the fact that scar tissue was adhered to his LIMA graft, doctors were afraid it could be catastrophic if he were to fall, for example.  He needed to have his chest reopened and repaired.  We found a cardiothoracic surgeon who had years of successful experience with titanium plates for “younger” open heart surgery patients, so just about a year after his initial surgery, he had a sternotomy.  The surgeon removed the broken wires, scar tissue, debrided the edges of his bone and used 4 titanium plates and wires to put him back together.  We were told his bone would be completely healed in 12-weeks. Fast forward 16-weeks later, after pain and problems, a CT scan revealed, the sternum hadn’t even started to mend!  There was no  bone growth.   Fast forward almost 1-1/2 years from the second surgery, there still has been no bone growth.  His surgeon was dumbfounded.  We went to see Cardiologists, Endocrinologists, Infectious Disease doctors, other specialists in the medical field, even naturalists, etc.  Nobody has a clue why his bone wouldn’t heal.  We asked everyone if they thought it was COVID related, and they all said a resounding, “no”.  They said there was no precedent, no evidence, no whatever…. During that time, we were able to have one of the doctor’s provide a referral for in-network benefits to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.   The request was approved for 6-visits, so we applied to have my husband seen at the Mayo’s Long Covid clinic.   After all this time with no answers from a variety of highly-educated, well-meaning doctors and specialists, it was during an initial virtual consult with the Mayo long COVID clinic that we were told that LONG COVID WAS THE REASON MY HUSBAND’S STERNUM WOULDN’T HEAL!   His central sensitization system was turned on when he had COVID, and for some reason, it has not turned off.  So essentially, he was in a perpetual FIGHT OR FLIGHT struggle, which contributes to a lot of the fatigue and other issues people have with LC, but it also says to my husband’s body, “hey buddy, you are in danger right now,  so your bone is going to have to wait to heal until you’re safe…”.  And since that fight or flight switch hasn’t turned off  on it’s own, he continues to suffer not only the other debilitating symptoms of Long COVID, but also the pain, clicking, popping, and restrictions associated with a non-healing sternum.  His life pretty much sucks, and as a result, so does the rest of our family.  If anyone else has had issues with bone healing, we’d like to know.  We are trying to get support from our insurance company to pay for him to continue working with the Mayo LC clinic, but they have denied multiple requests.   Fighting with the insurance company can be overwhelming to an already grueling, lonely journey of living with Long COVID. Thank you. "
Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/post-covid-increase-in-anxiety-and-palpitations/,Post Covid increase in anxiety and palpitations,"New to this board but after struggling for three months, I need some support. I tested positive for covid in December 2022 for the 1st time; I'll note that I am fully vaccinated and boosted. I experienced ""mild"" symptoms including the loss of taste and smell. I ran a fever for one day and generally felt tired. But just a couple days after I was no longer considered infectious, my issues began. My anxiety went through the roof; I began experiencing heart palpitations at an increased rate. My medication, that I had been on for well over 10 years, was not making a difference. I finally caved and visited my doctor after 3 weeks where she prescribed me some anxiety medication to add on to my current medicine before ordering me a holter monitor for a 2 week period. Over the monitoring period, my sleep was awful, my anxiety increased and I experienced some type of twitch or palpitations almost every day. It got to the point that my quality of life had decreased so much, my mom became very concerned with my behavior. When I finally submitted my monitor, my results came back normal. I had no afib and only a few instances of tachycardia which coincided with my mini panic attacks. My doctor discovered that I was experiencing PVCs or premature ventricular contractions that are most likely a result of stress and anxiety. I was put on a beta blocker to help with the symptoms. It's been about 2 months and while my symptoms have decreased significantly, I still experience pvc's which increase my anxiety which then increase my pvc's. It's a vicious cycle so I cling to the knowledge that my tests for my heart have been normal so that I can function. I would really like to know if others have experienced the same thing as me? Because I feel like I'm the only one who had such an experience with covid and it's impacting me. It doesn't help my anxiety or depression. At only 30 years only, it leaves me dreading the next few years fighting the symptoms and looking for solutions that may not be there.  "

My asthma was in control until January when I tried to decide if my fatigue was asthma, fatigue or depression or wait could it be age?

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/this-is-where-we-are/,This is Where We Are,"    You're going through a lot. We all are. So this community is vital. Being a part of the many studies helps the research community to understand, and it helps us know we're not alone.     But WE are the ones demanding to be heard, and are driving the reality that LC exists.     We–everyone in the world–need to accept that time is now  measured as BC (Before Covid) and AC (After Covid).  There is no normal now. That is reality.      No one has remained untouched by Covid. No one. And it affects not just our individual health, but people's mental health. The medical community in its entirety. Politics.  Planetary environment (Covid is found in, for example, the water supply, and the waste dearth of tests, masks, and gloves). Global and personal finances. Nothing has remained unravaged by Covid.      So no one suffering in an AC world is alone, though we feel we are. No one who cares for or about us is alone. This is a global community of those who suffer, and those who care.      We don't know too much. Or what this virus will eventually evolve into. It is endemic. The world placated, politically used, and ignored/spread falsification at our own peril.     What we have now is where we are.     We have bizarre, continuing, and varied physical and mental health issues. There is no real set of symptoms that can identify us as having LC. That is where we are.     And where we are, to those who read this, is a very large population of people who must learn to live with LC.     Where we are is here: Western medicine helps. But the allopathic method is to treat the body as individual parts, and to treat symptoms. So it can only help so much.     Exploring, trying, understanding Eastern approaches, naturopathic, traditional approaches treat the mind/body/spirit as a connected whole. Think Ayurveda, Native American, Chinese medical approaches.  Herbology.      In this way, all approaches, allopathic and traditional, can work together. There's a lot of push-back by the Western medical community, yes.     But where we are is that our health and well-being is our reality, our right, and our responsibility. 
    I hope we can, as a community here, and as a global community, can experiment and share our reality, what we try, what works, and what doesn't.     That is where we are.   "

they said i had bronchitis and gave me antibiotics steroids and an inhaler 
i didnt feel better 
i made an appointment with my new doctor

i sit and cough and hack up phlegm for an hour that seems to never stop and is so thick i can barely cough it up 
test results are always normal 
the doctors just want to push antidepressants and are referring me to psych because they havent dealt with longers 
i feel so scatterbrained most of the time and can finally make it through grocery shopping without feeling like im going to pass out 
i have hot flashes and break out sweating and get so fatigued 
i dont have muscle pain just some joint pain, severe thirst, insomnia,  the hot flashes, confusion, forgetfulness,  fogginess,   i misplace almost everything,  im short of breath all the time and other things like dry mouth, irritability, sadness, and time seems to pass so fast

Pediatrician did number of tests: boold, urine, stool, porphyria, helicobacter & tomography all seem to be fine or negative. Sent to digestive Dr, Dr did additional stool samples to test for blood and inflammation in intestines. Faecal calprotectin was 62.3 (normal values 26 – 50). Digestive Dr did no more tests. Told to see a psychologist so they could train her to increase her pain tolerance. 1 month later returned to A&E as pain intensified, on the third day in hospital had ultrasound, signs of fluid and partially swollen appendix,  appendix removed se day, more tests done in hospital all seemed normal. Since then had tummy infiltration as Dr's believed tummy problems due to abdominal wall, only caused more pain that subsided after 5-6 days, initial pain still remains.

I’ve had a myriad of issues since then but one of my most life-disrupting issues has been what I feel is a circadian rhythm disruption. Pre-Covid, I used to go to sleep at 10pm and wake up around 7am reliably without using an alarm. Now I fall asleep by 11pm but i will sleep till 2-3pm the next day and still feel sleepy and barely able to function until 5-6pm. Then I make dinner and such and exhaust myself in a short time doing these few things. 
This has made working nearly impossible. I went from full time at home work to a part time home job I can barely do.  The past 2 weeks I’ve been trying to force myself awake at 7-8am and the sleepiness is awful. I feel like I’ve been awake for days and desperate for sleep but around 5pm it switches to a more awake feeling until 10-11pm. 
So, essentially, I feel exhausted and half-asleep until 5pm no matter when I actually wake up. I wonder if that could be a hormonal change due to Covid, like, I don’t get the cortisol awakening until evening but the melatonin release happens on schedule. 
No amount of coffee helps either.   "

Went to dr. Who sent me to physical therapy. I couldn’t work, so no money for therapy. Then I got covid again in June, which set me back again. Dr referred me to post covid “research group” at university. They took my insurance, but each visit was going to be between $70 and $250 out of pocket, not including blood work, MRIs, CT scans, or any of the specialists (like neuro, or gastro, etc). I still haven’t worked at this point so no money to pay for any of it.  I was finally able to go back to work part time, usually under 15 hours a week, at$15/hr.

I just feel like it's a never ending nightmare, that most people don't understand. Unless you've suffered or still suffer from LC, most people don't get it or they think you're making shit up. 
I never used to be a hypochondriac before LC, and now I constantly live in fear for my health and life. I worry about chronic diseases, cancer, heart attacks, blot clots… just constant worry that I'll die from this. 
I don't know what to do anymore. I am grateful for being apart of this LC program at the U of M. I've seen countless specialists. It's comforting in some sense to get checked and to have doctors that try to help you figure out what's going on. But when tests come back normal, you feel back at square one. And you're still in pain. I just wish I could feel normal again. I feel like I don't even recognize myself anymore.

He said it had happened with other patients. He dialated my eyes & checked them out & said he couldn't see any damage to my eyes.

Went to PCP, pulmonary, ENT, neurologist and finally thoracic and after a month of tests found I had a small heital hernia and acid reflux.  Dr. said could easily be a combination of both GERD and long covid but the surgery to repair the hernia and relieve the GERD would mean I could not longer vomit.

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/post-covid-internal-vibrations-hair-loss/,Post Covid internal vibrations & hair loss ,"Hi, I’m a 61 yo woman who spent 16 days in ICU with bilateral. Pneumonia, acute kidney failure, acute respiratory failure & acute hypokalemia in Nov-Dec of 2021. To back up, I have had “Battles” with severe sepsis & septic shock off & on for the past 22 months & the etiology is still unknown! So after my last hospitalization in May, I noticed my hair was no longer falling out by the buckets after Covid; it was literally GONE within 5 days! I have been to every medical discipline known to man. They don’t know why I continue to get septic; but agree my hair loss is 100% due to long Covid. I guess I just assumed it was from the stress to my body from all 13 sepsis hospitalizations. About 8-10 weeks post Covid I had mild internal vibrations! Just brushed it off. Then they became more frequent, harder & lasting up to 2-3 hours. At first, I accused my friend of having a couch that vibrates. She looked at me like I’d lost my marbles & said “there is nothing vibrating”. Of course I insisted she come sit where I was & feel for herself… nothing. I said “well feel my arm”… she said “I don’t feel anything”. Then I stood up & said “Oh Sh…, the floor is vibrating really hard!” And again “NOPE”. I’ve been to a couple Dr.’s who have no idea why this is happening. I have an appointment with a Neurologist in Dec. & hopeful for some answers!  I’m so darn grateful I came across this website!! I’m shocked AND relieved that so many others suffer these vibrations. Mine happen more frequently when I lay down to sleep; but happen in addition to that at least 2-3 times during the day. When they are severe, I can’t walk around or drive. Mine are throughout my entire body. My feet & head are the worst. I feel my entire body jumping ; it amazes me that no one can see or feel them. My brain & teeth even feel like they are “trembling” ! Since I’ve gotten no answers, I’ve learned to just embrace it until someone comes up with a definitive DX &/or TX!! Now I just go lay in my bed & turn on my bed vibrator as high as it will go for as long as it takes! When my bed is vibrating, it makes my internal vibrations feel less apparent! I don’t venture out too far anymore because I’m a bit paranoid it will happen in public where there may not be a chair! I definitely lost my career probably indefinitely due to my health, which before sepsis was great! I have memory issues also; so working in a hospital caring for patients isn’t in the cards! In this journey of mine; I’ve had to rely on my new “motto” … “PAIN shapes a woman into a WARRIOR!”  And for the gal that I ran across also with hair loss issues; I share this with you: “You don’t need hair to wear your crown honey!” Peace & Love 💕 God Bless y’all, “May you find comfort from your afflictions through Jesus Christ our Lord & Savior”!! Stay faithful 🙏🏼🫶🏼♥️🙌🏼 "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heel-pain/,Heel pain after COVID-19 vaccine,"Five days before my first Covid 19 vaccine, after several hours of shopping and walking, I suddenly developed a bruised feeling under my right heel. Thinking it was from poorly fitting shoes, I next day switched to more padded and supportive shoes with a good arch support and gradually it began to subside. One hour after receiving my first vaccine shot, after sitting in my car all the hour, I stepped onto the parking lot to go shopping and felt the pain in my heel so strong that I couldn't walk! I sat down to stretch and massage my foot and then limped into the store to briefly shop. I lived very far away from any doctors, so wanted to stay close to the vaccine clinic for a while longer to make sure I had no serious side effects. For a few more days I researched causes of heel pain and called my doctor about it. I had guessed it was Plantar Fasciitis because the symptoms and relief from suggested therapies matched my own. My doctor suggested the vaccine caused inflammation and said to take tylenol if I needed it along with stretching, massage, icing and using arch supports. Two weeks after the second vaccine shot, along with intense self therapy, the pain is very gradually subsiding. It is very upsetting because I have never had any type of foot discomfort in my 72 years and some people in medical blogs said their intense discomfort wouldn't go away. Finally, yesterday I discovered wearing Nike Hyperdunk basketball sneakers with Heel the Pain inner soles completely eliminated the discomfort along with continuing the manual therapy. If it returns, I will visit my doctor. Is anyone else suffering from this condition and what is your story? "

There is no coughing, I’m just fatigue with chest discomfort .

I knew there had to be others having strange, unexplained issues.  November of 2021, I returned from traveling and 2 days later started experiencing diarrhea. At that time, NOBODY told us diarrhea was associated with Covid or could be only symptom. We now know you can have ONLY gastro symptoms with Covid. I did not have respiratory symptoms other than a slight runny nose. On day 4, I got a very bad headache that lasted for 2 days.  And exhaustion at night. Other than that, I felt ok. Diarrhea multiple times throughout the day. On day 13 of diarrhea, I went to an urgent care. The NP looked at me like I was an idiot because I hadn't been tested for Covid. Why would I? Informed me yes, you can present with ONLY diarrhea (who knew!) Said it was too late now, I had already been out and exposed people, and it may or may not show as positive after so many days. So – I never got an official diagnosis other than medical staff telling me ""duh, you have Covid…"". Day 14 was my last day with diarrhea. Then 2 weeks of extreme fatigue. AND – I've never had a normal stool again. Just hard round ""deer pellets"" – like large hard marbles. I do go, but never empty completely, and never a normal stool shape. I have used probiotics for many years, and am  otherwise VERY healthy. Yes, I've tried it all: kimchee, sauerkraut, nuts, vegetables, fruits, high fiber everything, ground flaxseed, chia seed, little to no processed foods, etc. I drink minimum 60 oz water a day. I exercise regularly and am active. It's nothing that I've done or am not eating correctly. And I didn't suddenly get IBS or Crohn's. I 100% believe my intestines were damaged from having intestinal Covid. My biome is broken. Seeing all of you describing long term symptoms (many so much worse) gives me hope maybe they'll figure this out. It's at least starting to be acknowledged.

To practice moderation: 
~ Break apart lengthy tasks. 
~ Alternate activities. 
~ Prioritize tasks. 
~ Take frequent rest breaks. 
~ Work at a moderate pace. 
~ Change the frequency of tasks. 
~ Delegate. 
~ Set time limits. Modification involves changing how you perform your activity to help conserve energy and reduce risk of injury. Examples of modification: 
~ Maintain good posture and body mechanics with all activities. 
~ Work sitting down when possible; conserve energy. 
~ Bend your knees, not your back to reach items or perform task 
    below hip height. 
~ Use tools appropriate for the job. These can include long-handle, 
    light weight, padded ergonomic grip handles, appropriate lengths 
    for your height and task. 
~ Push rather than pull to move heavy items. Ask for help when 
    needed (delegate).

I tested positive for COVID on Feb. 10, 2023. I just had a cough – no other symptoms. Took a course of Paxlovid. After about a week, tested negative and was able to go back to short spurts of exercise – swimming and walking. After another week, noticed severe exercise intolerance. I’d get short of breath and my pulse would slow to 48 and become irregular. Saw cardiologist and EKG was essentially normal. Wore a 24 hr. Holter monitor which showed some irregularities but doc did not feel they were significant. In the meantime, chest congestion was getting worse so my internist put me on a course of prednisone. Then my blood pressure shot up to 210/110 and I landed in the ER. I was trending toward hypertension so I was put on Amlodipine. I’ve gotten my BP under control and have days when the shortness of breath is not too bad. (I use an Albuterol inhaler which helps). Then today (3/25) I woke up really lightheaded and had what I think was an anxiety attack. I was afraid I was going to die. I’m feeling better as the day goes on but still lightheaded. It’s just one thing after another. I wonder if I’m ever going to get back to normal. 
I’m retired and don’t have to worry about work but my heart goes out to the younger ones who are experiencing similar post COVID symptoms and are unable to get back to work or a semblance of a normal life. I’m grateful to be able participate in this forum and read about other’s experiences and know that I’m not alone in all this. Thank you.  "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/help-with-long-covid-recovery/,Help with Long Covid Recovery,"I was diagnosed with Covid last Christmas (Dec 2022) and a few weeks later noticed head tremors/vibrations.  More symptoms developed in later weeks but I still didn't think LC  even though I was becoming more and more exhausted with little exertion.  In May I started physical therapy for my hurting knees and the more I exerted myself with exercises the more exhausted I got – then my symptoms went haywire and I had more tremors, lightheaded, nausea, breathlessness and finally first part of June heart palpatations and chest tightness, full throat feeling, couldn't tolerate the heat, constipation, brain fog, vein problems and more.   My sister in law said I probably had long covid so I started researching everything I could about LC.  I was shocked at what I found cause I thought LC only caused tiredness! Went back to my PC doc and to cardiologist but they can find nothing.  I have been reading about the research done and trying to follow the guidelines of Johns Hopkins LC Recovery Program and I do believe it is helping.  I would like to have a magic pill to hurry this process along but that just isn't available.   I have listened to probably 75-100 podcasts and presentations delivered via YouTube from researchers, doctors, clinicians around the world.  At first I couldn't get out of my recliner so I watched and listened all day.  I take notes because I can't remember very well with the brain fog. Two of the premier researchers into LC in my opinion are Dr David Putrino and his team at Mt Sinai  and Akiko Iwasaki from Yale Medical School.  They talk about best practices for recovery in many of their presentations on YouTube.  Johns Hopkins also has a Recovery program and I have attached their pdf here.    I am doing better — I can now walk outdoors about 10 minutes before the heavy breathing and chest tightness starts. I'm able to get up and do things around the house.  I now have hope.    Here is a link to the recover program pdf.   "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/never-say-never/,Never say Never: Covid and intensely itchy nose,"Three days ago I was diagnosed with Covid-19. Not a big deal in itself. However in the past two days one of my most distressing symptoms (believe it or not) has been an intensely itchy nose. There are other things too but while my nose is pouring like a tap, the itch has been unbearable……I beg you, please don’t laugh! Genetic sequencing has not been done to determine the precise Covid variant I have, however I assume it is one of the current Omicron subvariants in circulation, in July 2022, possibly BA.4 or BA.5. So, as you do, I did an internet search to find out whether an itchy nose was a prevailing symptom. This led me to a Mayo page comparing and contrasting symptoms associated with Covid-19, the Flu and Allergies. Wasn’t I surprised to find a categorical statement, on the Mayo site stating that NEVER was an itchy nose, mouth, eyes or ears associated with Covid-19. As I have never had allergies and am unlikely to have developed them in the precise window of time that I have ‘caught’ Covid, all I can assume is that the Mayo information is either not up to date for the current variants or is overtly incorrect. Any thoughts? "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-icu-ventilator-trache-lung-fibrosis-esophageal-dysphasia/,"Severe Covid,ICU,Ventilator,Trache,lung fibrosis,esophageal dysphasia ","I was infected with Covid and hospitalised for 4.5 months in 2021.  I would like to help others thru my story and recovery progress if I can. I was in ICU during the Delta variant in 2021, on ventilator, had trache in my throat. I also experienced vivid hallucinations and crazy dreams while in the ICU and after. I lost ability to distinguish what was the reality   and what was the dream. I was convinced there were people trying to kill me.  It was a very traumatic experience.  I am so grateful and happy to be alive today. It has been two years now since getting infected. I’m still recovering and not socially active but getting better and better with each day. I had to learn to walk again, breathe differently, work on my extremely deconditioned body and mind. 
I have been focused on maximizing my efforts to get to my 100% recovery fast. New goal to get to 💯 is the end of the year 2023. As of today August 31,2023 I now only use oxygen at night 1.5L. During daytime I get shortness of breath on exertion so I bring my portable oxygen with me whenever leaving my house. I can breathe on my own without portable oxygen when sitting and doing nothing. I was able to get off the daytime oxygen very slowly, it took me about 7 months after being discharged from the hospital. I did home care therapies for the first 5 months, then outpatient pulmonary rehab for 5 wks once I was able to drive again. It really helped me learn to breathe differently. I have been working from home part time for the first 5 months after discharge from hospital and then full time remotely for a year after. Right now I work 50/50 from home and remotely. I still can’t taste nor smell. I still experience memory issues, focus and concentration issues, lack of energy, swallowing issues, and sleeping disturbance. Recently I was diagnosed with esophageal dismotility and dysphagia, it’s also a post covid issue as I started choking on water after my first 14 days in the hospital. It was before ICU and the intubation. I still have trouble swallowing and coughing. Post hospital my lungs capacity was at 42% capacity and now 2 years later it’s close to 74%.  I’m getting better slowly but surely and it does take work to retrain the brain, the lungs, and to dealing with constant shortness of breath and exhaustion.  I had extreme anxiety and panic attacks which subsided a lot now. My heart rate was very high while BP was very low, while in hospital I was told by my cardiologist it was due to the autonomic disfunction. The brain and heart communication was dysfunctional when brain was telling the heart how many beats it’s supposed to beat. Covid messed up with my brain. Maybe because I was Covid positive for 45 days contributed to such variety of problems this horrible virus could affect in my body. 
There are still several post covid issues but I am determined to keep moving forward with great attitude and thankfullness to God for preserving my life. 🙏🫶 "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/washington-post-must-read-we-are-not-alone/,Washington Post must read: We are not alone,"Friends,  Sending love and a reminder to  take heart and have courage.  Attached Washington Post article is a reminder that we are writing the text book on Long Covid as we live it — and we need to take control of making a life that heals and honors our bodies as they are.  For most of us this means doing less, knowing our limits, nutrition packing, stress reduction, ignoring quick fixes (and those who propose them), loving ourselves, and enjoying to the hilt what we still can do.  Many of the Long haul problems are similar to ME/Chronic Fatigue and the resulting Central Sensitization; and those have been holistically treated.  None of this is easy — and God knows I have had huge bouts of hopelessness; but that’s where the courage comes in.  I reread chapters of “Cured: Strengthen Your Immune System and Heal Your Life” by Dr. Redinger from Harvard Med School (which is based on 20 years of research on cases of spontaneous healing when traditional medicine predicted death) when I need to replenish my hope.  What the survivors in Redinger’s illustrative cases did suggests a set of holistic patterns that embrace Eastern and Western healing practices — and self-trust to learn their own bodies and find the path to healing that works for them.  Much in that book is similar to the advice of my doctor and others in the Mayo Post Covid Clinic.  All that fuels my patience, persistence, and discipline — and slowly things are turning around for me.   My love and prayers for all who suffer from something the traditional medical community knows so little about — a condition the World Health Organization estimates that 65 million people suffer from worldwide.  Let us stand together to share hope and our strategies as we forge our own paths to regained health.  Onward, embraced by caring communities like this !

When I first noticed, I showed it to my neurologist at an appointment thinking it was a lymph node.  He said, I can see your heart beat through the ‘lump’ and he showed visible signs of concern and immediately sent me for MRI of my carotid arteries.  That was all fine, thank goodness.  From there I was sent to a vascular Doc for ultrasound, CT scan etc… all results came back normal. 
  Today at a physical with the nurse practitioner at my PC office, I mentioned that it is still very much present. Now, 2 years later, they are super concerned that it is an enlarged lymph node and are sending me for further diagnostics.

I’m sixteen plus months of feeling underwater with ear pressure.  My symptoms started after I thought I was fully recovered from a moderate case of Covid.  Six weeks after Covid infection we went to Hawaii.  The plane flight seemed to trigger these ear issues. It started just as the ear pressure thing, but over these last many months it has cascaded into, tinnitus, hyperacusis, dizziness, blurry vision, and just as a bonus I get intermittent swollen nasal passages.  It’s as if my whole head is closing up on me.  Not surprisingly I’m now pretty anxious because I’m not stable, and the ear pressure and other symptoms continue to worsen. I see reference to ear issues now and then, but with most people it seems to be their lesser issue.  Believe me I count my blessings that I have had very little pain, but my symptoms have me going nuts. 
I’d love to hear from any others out there who might be similar to me.

Trust me, I am not an hypochondriac, though it does look like I might be.  Until this, many times a few years would go by without my seeing a doctor.

 Of course I still have symptoms but I am much improved over what I was in June.  I still have brain fog, tremors in head and upper body, headaches at times, heat bothers me, stomach pain if I eat a lot at one time especially after 4pm.  I still can't do my morning walk more than about 3-4 minutes without my heart rate going up to 135 from about 65 resting rate. 
In June I couldn't be on my feet more than about 30 minutes in the house and needed to lay down for an hour or two because I was totally exhausted and weak.  I am now able to be on my feet around the house or shopping –(moving slowly though) for about 3 hours before I become weak and need to lay down. 
The only really frustrating symptom is the weakness that comes on when I try to walk any distance.  I'm still not able to do it when back in the spring I was walking about 45-60 min a day.  However I found that exercise laying down or sitting is tolerable within limits — such as a recumbent bike, chair exercises, etc.

The diagnoses have changed over time (lupus, not lupus, spondyloarthropathy, akylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Raynaud's, Sjorgren and maybe others that I have forgotten… sorry about the spelling). When I took Paxlovid for Covid, many of my symptoms disappeared or were significantly reduced. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm thinking that perhaps my autoimmune disease is somehow based on a VIRUS, since paxlovid is an anti-viral and it was like a miracle cure for my symptoms. I told my rheumatologist about it, but I couldn't get her to focus on the logical connection between the anti-viral (paxlovid) and the reduction in my symptoms. It was very frustrating. I actually cried in my car after the appointment. I think this could be a game-changing piece of evidence in my medical treatment and diagnosis. And maybe for other autoimmune disease sufferers, too! But I don't know where to turn with this evidence. What do you think I should do? What doctor should I go to? 
My primary care doctor probably won't offer anything; he never intervenes in my rheumatological care. Please let me know if you had the same experience: an anti-viral medication (paxlovid or another one) reduced your autoimmune/arthritis symptoms. I searched around online, and it was hard to find and hard to understand information there. In the CDC's PubMed, I found one source that indicates the possibility that immune suppressing medications can reactivate the Epstein Barr virus in some patients. Epstein Barr causes fatigue, among other symptoms, but fatigue is one of my worst symptoms.   Thanks! "

Labs came back showing low B-12 and ferritin (still within normal range but low normal) She sent me to a Hematologist/Oncologist.   Had appt 2 weeks ago.  He walked in the room talking a hundred miles an hour, said he looked at my chart, labs and that I had a ton of work done and seen numerous docs (of course I was referred because no docs can figure it out) wouldn't even look at me to discuss how I'm feeling, my symptoms, examine me. . . nada.  Said you need B-12 injections and iron infusions.  What?  When I tried to ask questions, and share some of symptoms, etc he was already  was walking out of the room.

I DECIDED TO LEAVE HIS CARE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T CARE TO HELP WHATSOEVER. I explained for my purposes (she also saw Heme-Onc at MCW which agreed w my following assessment), we can correct her iron and b12.  I discussed AE's from IV iron including infusion reactions.  NEVER DISCUSS REACTIONS.  I'M PROBABLY ADDING FUEL TO MY ALRADY FIRE WITH LT COVID. Of note GI here, Dr G suggested her issues are functional in nature.  She told me he does not believe she is eating what she describes and indeed she has not documented it for him.  He offered a full workup for absorption, also a PEG, but she declined his recommendation/offer for anything earlier this month.  NOT TRUE!  I DID AN ABSORBTION TEST AND DIDN'T SEE ANY SENSE IN REPEATING.  ALSO, DAILY FOOD DIARY KEPT AS WELL AS DOCUMENTED WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL!  Clearly she has some issues w mental health documented, also her use of various doctors across multiple systems (NW, MCW, Advocate, Froedtert South, Ascension), suggests to some degree problems with reliability, insight, openness to ideas/options and/or secondary gain.  WHAT?  ""mental health issue?*^%%$!    YES, I HAVE ANXIETY, BUT WHO WOULDN'T AFTER SUFFERING 3 YRS AND GETTING NO HELP WHATSOEVER. She declined further Gi eval. I explained IV iron, causes (bleeding absorption issues), start iron b12 now, cbc/ferritin in 2-3 mo.  See me then. I ASKED IF HE FEELS I HAVE LOW IRON DUE TO INTERNAL BLEEDING AND HE SAID NO. I suggest return to tertiary care for various complaints but also suggested better longitudinal care w a PCP to coordinate.   NEVER MENTIONED ANY SUCH THING, SINCE HE REALLY WOULDN'T TALK TO ME. I give up and going into the basemen to scream and cry.  I have nowhere to turn.  This is why when I was down to 89 lbs and went to the hospital they wouldn't help and dismissed me next day.

Went to Urgent Care fearing Covid again, test was negative.  Now I noticed a red spot on back of throat with a white/cream colored spot in center and neck feels tender.  Last endo said I had lymph nodes.  I called the Oncologist/Hematologist informing them because I want to make sure there is no conflict or danger in getting the iron infusion with this newly formed spot in back of throat and asked the nurse to talk to the doctor, and she said he wouldn't get involved in this and just come in for the infusion.  ALSO, my new labs show low Zinc – hello Covid and immune system, but not one Doc will listen or even cares.   Even when I developed the chalazion below lower lash line, Derm said it's usually due to an immune disorder, I had to have 2 surgeries became it became infected, still there and gets ignored.

I felt almost cured in early May this year.  Then the Omicron booster sent me into worse-than-ever relapse, within 72 hours after the shot. Then, a week ago, I started to get dramatically worse. Something was going on beyond just long covid.  I had a covid test, and tested positive for tne virus.  I started taking Paxlovid and immediately improved.  This is day three of Paxlovid.  I am not quite as chipper as I was in early May (right before the Omicron disaster).  But  close. My intuition is (not qutte) science.

Doctors have examined and scanned me from head to toe without finding anything. I am in good physical shape. I have developed coping mechanisms for the physical symptoms, and I am grateful my condition is so mild. But … Typical disagreements with my wife (married 46 years) now cause my symptoms to flare up significantly, as if my tolerance for stress has severely eroded in spite of a long career (now retired) during which I thrived in extremely stressful situations. While my cognitive functions are working well (I study quantum mechanics), my emotions have become more changeable, and I mentally tire faster. I struggle to deal with the welter of mundane adjustments that make a household work. My wife says I am not the positive person I used to be and I am depressed. I feel as if long Covid has reduced my emotional immune system.  To cope so far I listen to humorous media, favorite music, and old shows, and read more uplifting material about humanity and its achievements.

Would anyone have any insight as to why I keep getting Covid and never fully recover?  I forgot to mention, ever since getting Covid, my endocrine system has completely flaked out. Starting with thyroid going from overactive to under active. Later learned that my adrenal glands are pretty much shot. I produce almost no cortisol. My functional medicine doctor has me on Low Dose Naltrexone. At least my thyroid is staying in check on this. Adrenal glands, not yet. Thanks, Dan, Kansas City, MO "
Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/longest-lasting-symptom-after-covid/,Longest lasting symptom after Covid,"Long story short….I had a confirmed case of covid in Jan of 22 and think i had it before tests were available. 
Went through some dark times and bad anxiety attacks and depression and cognitive issues. 
Thankfully with time and meds i am doing much better….I am not where i was pre covid but so much better. 
I am starting to feel human again. 
I hope i return to 100% But part of me says this is the best i am gonna get and i am thankful for that as so many are worse off. 
The one thing i cant shake is shortness of breath if i do anything physical. 
My wife helps me mow the lawn now because i spend a hr afterwards before i my breathing returns to normal. 
Its like i cant get enough air and it wipes me out. 
Have spoken with others who said their shortness of breath was the last symptom to improve. 
i am to the point where maybe asking my pcp if a inhaler might help. 
Just wandering what symptoms lasted the longest from those who have had long covid symptoms and what helped? 
I know i am older but i am only 54 and it drives me nuts not being able to do the things i could do only 2-3 yrs ago. 
Thank you. "
Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-helped-to-reduce-my-internal-vibrations/,What helped to reduce my internal vibrations,"I am sorry to read everyone's story and relieved that I am not alone. I have never tested postitive for covid but I feel that vaccine has a part in cauaing or at least contributed in worsening my symptoms; pain, tinglings, twitching and internal vibrations. I  have complex symptoms I cannot count. I have a lot to say about my experience, maybe another time but just a quick message to say that I don't know what's causing them but some supplements, especially making radical changes in my diet seem to reduce my internal vibrations. Supplements alone didn't indeed stop them but stopping to eat many food did reduce them significantly. I don't know if it will work in your own case but maybe worth trying. Fasting also reduce the vibrations. I basically eat meat, chicken, vegetables (greens, cauliflowers, broccoli, zuccini, fresh peppers, hot pepper, spices, seeds, etc.) and mostly shelled nuts (less processed) but other nuts and seeds as well and drink bone broth. No gluten, no diary, no lactose, no fruit. I avoid eating scratcy vegetables (no peas, potato, etc), no rice, grains, lentils or fruit except blueberries and alike. I lost about 3 kgs but feel better although muscle twitchings are happening more often. I opted to olive oil mostly. I avoid frying my food. Also no sugar, no desserts, no coffee (rarely), eggs (rarely), no herbal tea, no gluten free flour or packaged gluten-free food because they are processed and have rice and corn flour in them etc. Avoid flour in general. I prefer hot water with frech ginger, fresh lemon juice, cinnamon, cloves black pepper and turmenic powder. I make green vegetable soup with chicken, ginger, hot pepper, etc. mostly.  Be careful with the amount of lemon juice. I make my choices based on anti inflammatory and anti toxic approach as much as possible. I stopped using cosmetics like creams. I use natural soap. I opted for natural oils for my face and body which I use every day. I mix some oils and apply this on my body which seem to reduce or stop esp. nerve(?) pain on my low left side + my low back pain. I have been taking propolis powder and bee polen every day with water, vitamin B complex, a-lipoic acid (2 months), probiotics that are bile resistant (continous), – Vitamin C (could be with Rosehips & Citrus Bioflavonoids) – one table each gluten and lactose free. Also omega 3 (in triglyceride form, 2×1) OR krill oil (1×1). I have been taking probiotics for the last 7 months. I have been taking all others for the last 1,5-2 months. I have also used anti-parasitic medicine a few weeks ago and was on some anti-fungal medication for vaginal ph imbalance die to previous infections. I have a history of reoccuring UTIs and antibiotics didn't seem to work but make me feel worse. My immune seem to be weak. I try to avoid taking medicatios excepts some supplements as mentioned above. I will probably stopped alpha lipoic acid after finishing the box, and switch to a multivitamin and mineral after I finish vitamin B complex. I would particularly suggest to begin with a slow elimination of your diet and be patient. My approach again was to not eat too much and target healing the gut.  I know how desperate one can feel and hope this helps someone. Please be careful when applying, always observe how you feel. I guess one needs to stick to this strick diet to see results if one can tolerate it. Please let me know if you see any changes. I still have other symptoms but this approach helped with reducing the internal vibrations significantly. I will try to write my story maybe another day. Best wishes. "

One person (Denglish) had posted something she had researched and found that worked for her.  She said she is 90% better.  I have taken her trial and am doing it for myself.  I'm trying everything I can read about and giving it a try.  This is working.  It took about two weeks before this method has started to work, but I feel fantastic.  It doesn't feel like a teaser. 
This is what I'm doing.  It's pretty much what she had advised to try. 
I take 500 MG of Niacinamide 3 times a day. I drink 32 oz. of LMNT electrolyte's in water every day.  For breakfast I eat oatmeal with a cup of blueberries and cook one egg in the oatmeal for protein.  For lunch I juice (not a smoothie) 1 carrot, 1 whole beet and the greens, 1/2 a lime (the greens by themselves are pretty rough), 10 kale leaves, 2 apples.  I also eat 2 cups of Greek Yogurt with blue berries in it. 
Dinner I eat what I want.  This is very healthy and a great weight control habit.  Also no pickled products.  This is a low histamine diet to control the inflammation that is happening in the cells of our bodies. 
I've been doing this for three weeks now.  The first two weeks  of this were brutal.  Then 7 day's ago I woke up and felt pretty darn good.  It lasted for 5 day's.  Yesterday was day 6 and I was a bit dizzy and tired, but it wasn't terribly bad.  Today I feel fantastic.  I've been  extremely busy the last week getting things done.  I know it's not gone.  Just like everyone else I'm still constipated.  So I know it's still lurking about but the brain fog, dizziness, lack of energy, and all the things that I read we are all suffering with feel to be taking a vacation. 
Please, Please, Please give this a try.  I'm 65 and am in really good health except for this Demon we all have taken on.  I have been miserable  just like all of us have been.  It worked for Denglish and It seems to be helping me.  I want this gone and will let everyone know how I feel again in a couple of weeks. 
 Good luck everyone.  Please give this a try. "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/long-covid-symptoms-help/,Long-Covid symptoms help,"Hi everyone. I’ve been suffering from I’m pretty sure are the effects of Long Covid, but I’ll try to give as much details as possible, as I’d really appreciate any advice it insight on how long this is all going to last for me.  Here goes. Roughly 6 weeks ago, I fell very ill with the usual onset of symptoms: Fever, headache, cough, body aches, loss of taste/smell, etc. 
I took a Covid test and it was surprisingly negative. My working theory is that I was actually positive and the test just registered a false negative.  After roughly two weeks, the flu-like symptoms resolved, however, I was left with horrendous body aches, debilitating fatigue, brain fog, itchy rash/hives on fingers and hands, loss of appetite, occasional irregular heartbeat here and there, and personality changes.  The symptoms fluctuate from me almost feeling normal again and go right back to leaving me bed ridden. It’s like an endless rollercoaster of nonstop symptomatic hell.  I can’t work or really do too much of anything, so I’m pretty much relegated to laying around the house and googling to try and find some answers as to when this nightmare will possibly come to an end.  If anyone either was or is in my position, I’d gladly appreciate any insight or speculation as to when this may fully resolve.  Thank you and I hope to hear from at least a few of you out there.  "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/epstein-barr-treatment-for-long-covid/,Epstein-Barr Treatment for Long Covid?,"First, a little background: I'm 9 months in to Long Covid and just ended a treatment regimen designed by the InCellDx / Innovative Bioanalysis research group (Dr. Patterson et al).  After 4 months of many medications that produced no results and only decreased my quality of life with side effects, I'm calling it.  The only medication that improved my functioning was Ivermectin (which did so dramatically), but even that has plateaued for several months now. I'm now waiting until the end of October to be seen at Stanford's Post-Acute Covid Syndrome clinic and have little to no hope for that either.   The only explanation for my Long-Covid that has ever made sense to me is the theory that the virus re-activates latent Epstein-Barr in the blood. I had a very bad case of mono from age 15-17 that absolutely wrecked me, and some of my covid symptoms resemble my experience of mono, so this theory makes sense to me.  For those of you who resonate with this theory and are seeking / have found treatment based on this assumption, what are you doing for treatment? Are you being prescribed medications, infusions, etc?

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-has-caused-auto-immunity-food-reactions/,Covid-19 has caused auto immunity food reactions,"I want to share my story in hopes that it will help others. I thought that a reaction to covid had caused gluten intolerance. I now know, beyond doubt, that my 18 months of GI misery, dehydration, and laxative dependence has been cause by multiple intolerances to several different food groups. The main one is a huge intolerance to any and all wheat products. This includes oatmeal, which is technically gluten free, but has prolamins that can very closely cause/ mimic gluten reactivity. The version of wheat intolerance I have developed, at the age of 70, does not show up in the celiac blood test profile. It is there for what is called non celiac Gluten intolerance/reactivity. It is written about, known to the medical establishment, poorly understood, and can only be diagnosed by an M.D. through observation of wheat, use, then stopping use for a period, then reuse, all under M.D. observation. HOWEVER, there is one blood test, practiced by some nutritionists, that is controversial, but in my particular situation was totally accurate in diagnosing my wheat intolerance. It is the MRT, Mediator Release Test. This will save you the hell of an on/off observational M.D. review of watching you suffer the affects of a wheat reaction. The MRT had a wheat reaction of my blood as 3.3, on a scale of 0-3.0. Which is basically an off the charts reaction to wheat. My physical reaction is a big auto-immune response. If I eat wheat, my GI system basically becomes dehydrated, constipated, and my foot/ankle joints swell up the size of grapefruits. The MRT brought other suspected intolerances to my attention. There is no other explanation, other than covid has caused a massive auto immune response that is just about 100% food group related. I have been avoiding the trouble foods from the MRT for about 3 weeks, and it has finally working for me. The MRT flagged the following foods, from my blood test as highly reactive-Wheat,almond,avocado, buckwheat,cashew,chard,corn,garlic,Goat's Milk,grapefruit,green bean,Jalapeno.lemon,lima bean.potassium nitrite, potato,spinach,sunflower, sweet potato,vanilla, brewer's yeast and bakers yeast. I have to the extent possible avoided all of these. My only quibble with the test results would be the low reactivity exhibited by other gluten products, barley, rye, spelt, etc. I did try the barley, with disasterous results, but learned the lesson- ALL WHEAT/Gluten for me is totally off limits. So is any food on MY reactive list. Oatmeal is also reactive more so than the test indicated. But I have to say in general, and I realize, the MRT is contoversial, NOT EMBRACED by the medical industry, but I am convinced it does have a seat at the table when trying to diagnose, and manage the GI issues, which are basically, in my personal case, and maybe numerous other peoples, auto respsonses, based on diet,as my hugely swollen ankle joints(now in remission), would indicate. My wife has observed all mof this for the past 18 months and is in total agreement. "
Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/severe-allergy-to-paxlovid/,Severe Allergy to Paxlovid,"I am desperate and I can't find anyone out there that is talking about this. It has drastically altered my quality of life. If I can get answers or help someone else, this post is worth it. I had Covid in May '22. I took Paxlovid on day 3 as my Covid symptoms caused my asthma to flare. Within the first hour my face started itching & I didn’t know it then, but I was clearly allergic to the drug. I read all the paperwork I was given and there was no warning of this, but now looking online, Paxlovid warns of severe allergic reactions that involve everything I’m experiencing. As someone with a lot of allergies, in the middle of pollen season, I didn’t realize it was the meds until too late. After finishing the 5 days of Paxlovid, I had a full on face rash and hives that lasted for a MONTH. After the 1st round healed, the insanely itchy hives and rash returned on a monthly basis, each episode lasting a min of 2 weeks, with no apparent trigger. I tried every single histamine blocker in western & eastern medicine, have more ice packs than food in my freezer, & took a 2 week dose of Prednisone and got no relief. I work for a functional medicine doctor and she's been trying to help. After 7 months of wanting to crawl out of my skin, I gave in to doctors 5 week high dose Prednisone. It stopped the monthly cycle of hives with no trigger & shifted it to rash and hives, but with allergies & stress being the obvious triggers. So there must be some relation to hEDS, MCAS, Paxlovid, Covid, Autoimmune that can alter how the body reacts to triggers in people with severe allergies, etc. But I can’t find ANYONE that’s talking about it. I can’t be the only one. My histamine tests come back normal, so I'm looking into prostaglandin levels. As an hEDS and MCAS person we often have negative test results which only leads to more frustration, but clearly SOMETHING is happening. After that the hives and rash returned based on exposure to known (dust) & unknown (glitter) allergens & stress. Paxlovid has altered or triggered something in my system that changed the way histamine and/or prostaglandin of Mast Cells in my body react to stress/allergies & for some very strange reason the hives and rash localized themselves on my face & neck. After the hives start to dissipate, the heat from the hives which has gotten up to 103 degrees has burned my face and then my face starts to peel for days.   During the 1st episode, I filed a report with Pfizer, but never received a response. I asked multiple Allergist’s & specialties & all they do is shove prednisone at me because they are stumped. I tried to find an MCAS specialist, but they either are not taking any new patients or they don’t take my insurance. My current allergist has no idea what to do and sent me to Emory, but Emory is refusing all new allergy patients. I cannot live like this and I hope there is some positive insight out there. I know I’m in the 1% and I’m sick of doctors telling me, “You’re in the 1% and I can’t help you.”  After a year and a half of dealing with this, I'm losing my mind and my mental health is being severely altered.

They were so kind and helpful: 1) The slimy mucousy saliva that I have had since Covid could possibly be caused by Covid attacking my gut, GERD (reflux) and this stuff lies in the back of your throat. Diet will help this….no citrus fruits. Salt makes it worse. Mucous thinner helps, but, is not a cure for me. Antihistamines help, but, I use sparingly as it dries out my eyes. There seems to be no cure at present and hopefully it will wear itself out. 2) I have had asthmatic bronchitis, then I developed pneumonia & sinus infection since the first week of July. This is still not completely gone away. Long Covid attacked my upper respiratory and I was told this week it is going to take me longer to heal than a normal person due to LONG COVID. I am 2 months out from seeing a Pulmonologist for this as doctors are so backed up now. 3) I have ongoing fatigue from long Covid. Rest as much as possible is the key. 4) When I get cleared up from all this upper respiratory stuff, I will go back for a fuller evaluation of my ongoing symptoms. This evaluation is about 2-3 hours long and will include nutrition and taking each symptom one at a time. 5) It is believed Covid affected my immune system and that is why I am having a questionable diagnosis of Lupus or Mixed Connective Tissue Disease. The Rheumatologist jury is still out on that one. 6) My own takeaway was that each of us have to determine the right diet, exercise, rest and I am even going to an holistic/integrative medicine doctor that thinks outside the box. Infusions maybe to “up” my immune system? Yes, I do take several vitamins to hopefully improve my immune system. 7) I personally think Covid also affected my already present thyroid diseases (Hashimotos/Graves Disease) as I am having more palpitations from thyroid (I was sent to cardiologist and my heart is fine – Praise the Lord) since Covid. I pray for all of you that have long Covid. It is real. Blessings & Prayers…. P.S. I am not sure if is permissable to list a book on here, so if not, someone just slap my wrist, but, I am reading “The Long Covid Solution” by Carla Kuon, MD. I do not agree with everything, but, 98% of it is more informative and straight forward. "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/speech-cognitive-therapy-helped-me/,Speech & cognitive therapy helped me,"I’ve had long Covid since May 2022.  I attended 12 sessions at the Shirley Ryan Ability Center in Chicago. 
The very modern floor that housed speech therapy has a waiting area for people undergoing occupation therapy- learning how to walk after a leg amputation, learning how to turn a doorknob, and physically twisted and contorted, but they were all working towards a recovery. 
When I got to the speech therapist, she said , “you’re the same as the other patients out there. You likely will not return to your old self.  But we will work on developing new abilities and tools so you can live the life you want.” 
That was eye opening. I did every damn thing they taught me and still do.  For me, it was breathing, thinking and speaking more deliberately, and slowing down overall. 
Brain fog was killing me. I didn’t realize speech therapy begins with the brain’s ability to process information then verbally communicate and 
listen 
It’s less difficult to speak clearly and avoid out-of-breath stuttering and trying to squeeze thoughts out. It got really bad a few months ago. 
That, along with medication to help me focus, pacing, and diet has moved me in a better direction.  "

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/post-covid-sinuses-fill-when-i-lie-down-preventing-sleep-1/,Post COVID - Sinuses fill when I lie down preventing sleep!,"I had Covid just before Christmas/ end of 2021. Since then I have suffered each night when I lie down with Post Nasal Drip /catarrh. I have not had close to a good night’s sleep now since and it’s really affecting my mood and quality of life. I have considered and been treated for allergies and feel certain my condition is not a reaction to environmental or seasonal allergy – see below: I have suffered from hay fever, and cat allergies in the past – resulting in streaming nose and eyes – but a simple antihistamine has dramatically reduced my symptoms. With the catarrh, the predominant symptom appears to be the continuous collection of thick mucus (or whatever it is) from behind my nose which I continuously feel the need to draw down into my throat and swallow as I am lying down. I have also been through ten continuous seasons now, and travelled abroad, with no discernible difference to my symptoms. Regardless of where I am in the world; pets or no pets; carpet or no carpet; indoors or outdoors; or what medication I take the catarrh persists. So far I have taken courses of loratadine, cetirizine, promethazine, fexofenadine hydrochloride, benadryl, prednisolone, flixonase/fluticasone, montelukast, sterimar nasal solution, dymista and doxycycline. In addition, I have introduced an air purifier into the bedroom, and a humidifier. I also perform regular nasal washes especially before bed and have tried sleeping propped up. Any combination of the above may have reduced my symptoms by some 10-20%, but I might just have imagined it as some nights are better than others. I remain convinced that my condition is somehow Covid related as I did not suffer at all with it before I had Covid in 2021, but I have suffered ever since. Of course I am keen to resolve this issue as I cannot imagine living with it indefinitely – I am so exhausted by it and the resultant insomnia which is really taking its toll. I am SO fed up. It would be great to know I'm not alone with this problem, and of course any shared remedies would be most welcome.

Covid,https://connect.mayoclinic.org/discussion/im-very-supportive-but-she-doesnt-want-it/,"I'm very supportive, but she doesn't want it","I have read multiple people on the forum talk about a significant other not taking the reality of long Covid seriously. I have the exact opposite issue, and I feel so alone in it and do not know what further to do. My girlfriend was very conscientious to get all vaccines and boosters. She went to a family funeral before Christmas and was worried she would still get Covid because she knew a lot of her relatives did not get vaccinated. And it happened. And it became horrible. She has coughed so much that she has lost her voice and actually cracked two ribs. She is asleep practically any minute she is at home. She gets up and goes to work to keep her health insurance, but she really needs to rest a long time. I offered to move her to my place and pay for her insurance and let her rest. No. Okay, that's a big life decision.  But here's the thing: I actually love her more and have been so intentional to try to show it in every way you could imagine. I don't think I should deserve to be with this incredible woman when she gets better if I can't stay with her now. We are not married, but I am completely about ""in sickness and in health."" But she is not. She not only does not return love of any kind, but far worse: she does not want my love and tells me so. It is so baffling that she would not want a healthy resource and support that requires nothing from her. It is not like her in the least. She will occasionally say she appreciates me but not directly that she loves me, and this woman's love completely turned around my life after a horrible previous marriage. I am so loyal to her, so good to her, and I know she's in hell. But my feelings matter too, and I feel so alone that I am really about to lose my psychological balance. And I fear she will never love me again like we had even if she gets better, and certainly even now I probably need to start acting as if I never expect her to do so. I am beyond devastated. I don't know if her reaction is because the disease is short circuiting things in her, if her lifelong habit has been to handle things only by herself when in crisis mode or what, but she so obviously needs what I so freely give, and yet she spurns it. No amount of encouragement, reminder of great memories, loyalty, singing to her, praying for her, humor, flirting, anything does any good whatsoever. Am I the only one who has been turned away by a significant other with long Covid? I need someone to talk to because she won't or can't. But I can't just leave her. Even if she deals with this the rest of her life, we both agreed our destiny was together forever, and I take that seriously. I just want her to say how she doesn't know what she would do without me or how my love helps keep her going. But no. If she addresses it at all, she says she does not and cannot even think about ""us."" My birthday last was last week. On it, she always makes me feel so good, so lucky. I got a text: Big hugs on your special day. Really? That's what you might say to a niece, not a partner. No love, not even a memory of affection. I read last year's card just to tell myself this is who she was. But it's looking like who she was may be forever gone. I want to stay forever. I want to hear her tell me how she wanted to say how much she loved me but was held back by the disease. I want her to tell me I'm the best man in the world. But I've given everything I have for almost 3/4 of a year, and I have not received the slightest affirmation of being her man. I will never say I am as damaged by this as she is, but even there, we used to talk about how terrible it is always to be told that someone else hurts more than you because it nullifies your truth, your needs, your humanity. But that is what has happened. I don't matter. Nothing I do matters. She doesn't even say she wishes she could do things with me. I don't know how to find my self-worth again because it was completely connected to her loving me. "

Posting for a friend. ,"I'm posting this for a friend who's been dealing with an intermittent rapid heart rate for about a month now. Like many dealing with this, he's dealing with some anxiety and reading what other people are going through could cause more anxiety, so I'm posting this for him and filtering out the feedback. He's had COVID at least once (so bad that he had to get convalescent plasma). This was approx. a year ago.  Here are the details: He's 53 years old, non-smoker, non-drinker. This all started around mid-September. The only time his heart rate has been over 100 is when he went to the ER (twice now in the past month). Most of the time it's mid-80s. He has intermittent fatigue. He can be good one day then drained the next. He thinks he does have some brain fog and can't concentrate some times. Before all this started, he was walking a mile a day on a treadmill with no breathing issues.  This started out of the blue. One morning he woke up, opened his eyes (while still in bed) and felt dizzy and light headed.  That same day he lost his appetite.  The next day felt a little out of breath just walking around and noticed his heart going a little faster than usual. 
The day after that he walked three blocks and felt winded and felt weak in the knees. His heart was racing. Many times since then, he can be getting up from a chair and his heart will begin racing. For the past four weeks he's had intermittent episodes of his heart racing while at rest or just standing up. Most of the time his BP is good.  From what I've read on this forum this seems pretty typical. I've read many people they say they've had these symptoms for months or 2-3 years.  Some say they've gotten relief from Metoprolol, Amantadine, or adding magnesium supplements to their diet.  Is there anything else he can try at this point? He just went to the ER tonight because his heart rate shot up to 114 and his BP was high (161/94). He's OK at the moment, but it's quite unnerving dealing with this (for everyone). "

After 2 weeks of rather mild covid (no breathing issues / fever) I developed what the urgent care dr told me was acute bronchitis.  We started me on prednisone, Mucinex, and promethazine DM for cough.   After a week, I had to go back and got another round of prednisone and Albuterol.

I caught the visible twitchings on camera and my dr called them fasciculations. So I will call those felt deep inside internal fasciculations. (I also have internal vibrations/tremors) but it is another story. My main pain is on the upper left side. I have random fasciculations around my body but when I lie in bed, I particularly feel twitchings/internal fasciculation at a particular point – a little above my waist near my spine, on the left side. The internal fasciculations at this small location have been persistent for a long time. (I do not know the cause of these symptoms however I believe that I have vaccine injury as well – after which I felt electric shocks in my left chest for a few days . My heart began to pump slowly following the vaccine and the booster; this followed with the left side pain, that's why I am posting it here.) I first had pain and tinglings. Internal vibrations and fasciculations followed almost a year later. Does anyone else have similar symptoms, particularly persistent internal fasciculations at a specific location near the spine? Has anyone got a diagnosis for this? I am just thinking… My tests a year ago seem clear but maybe I need more specified tests, I don't know.
