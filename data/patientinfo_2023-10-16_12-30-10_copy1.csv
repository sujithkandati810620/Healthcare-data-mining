Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/terrified-of-cystocopy-737230,Terrified of cystocopy,"I've got to have a cystoscopy next month. I'm absolutely terrified. It sounds like sheer hell.  But perhaps even worse than the excruciating pain is the psychological torture of it all. I was hoping to be sedated, but they refused. My initial appointment was so humiliating I couldn't even talk to my therapist about it. How do I survive the total humiliation of this? I fear I will never recover from the psychological trauma?  To make it worse, I don't have access to my therapist any more. 0 likes, 16 replies "
Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/legitimate-cystoscopy-fears-and-pain-674564,Legitimate Cystoscopy Fears and Pain,"Many patients both female and male have legimate reasons adressing fears when it comes to a variety of invasive medical proceedures. Such fears are not easily addressed in a mdical setting in the fast pace of the hospital arena. You never truly know how Doctors or Nurses are going to respect or consider the reasons for your fears. I believe one of the primary faults of medical professions is respecting ones right to privacy. Not all medical professionals are guilty of this but a lot of them are. And I'm not the only patient who sees this.  In my experience being a heterosexual man who was brutally tortured and gang-raped at gunpoint in the past, its very difficult addressing concerns about fear when invasive medical proceedures arise. Embarrasment, rejection, bias judgment amongst an assortment of other weary issues. I briefly addresed this to a Urologist and female nurse in my hospital room. Assuring me there was nothing to worry about nonchalantly. I went for a scheduled cystoscopy having stayed in hospital for a month from illness of having high fever with a kidney and bladder infection. Upon being placed on a typical hospital stainless steel examination table; the cystoscopy began with the Urologist injesting lidocaine jelly down into my urethra. He didn't wait for the lidocaine to take effect and immediately introduced a long cystoscopy tube. The burning pain was incredible and later subsided as I groaned in pain while he moved the cystoscope around inside my bladder. I don't know what type of cystoscope he used. I was p****d off at him afer and let him know under no uncertain terms. I told him he was a f...ing idiot. He did find four polyps inside my bladder and a blocked kidney ureter. I'm awaiting surgery. I hear so many patients particularly male who claim they never experienced pain during cystoscopy exams. Your the dang lucky ones. 0 likes, 9 replies "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/blood-after-urinating-and-cystoscopy-please-advise-747173,Blood after urinating and Cystoscopy. Please advise,"Hi everyone, I am seeking an advice and i would really appreciate sharing your experience or if you have any information. I am 46 year old male taxi driver, sometimes I need to urinate when I am stuck in traffic in the town centre and there is no parking or toilet to go to. last week I needed the toilet but I was in a middle of traffic jam for more than an hour and was unable to go out of my car. so I tried to empty my bladder in a bottle while I was sitting, taking out half of my penis of the trouser with a little pressure from the trouser on my penis, I felt some pain while urinating as the position was not comfortable at all. when I got home after two hours, I entered the toilet and felt burn sensation while urinating and blood came out after I finished, that has happened two times on that day. blood disappeared after that and everything was ok. I called my gp just to check if thats normal. it was Friday evening so Dr prescribed antibiotic and asked me to do urine test on Monday morning. urine test came clear so gp referred me to hospital and Dr said because there was blood and no infection they need to check out the reason. I did   and CT scan, everything is ok, so they booked an appointment to do a cystoscopy! I started to worry now, I thought that everything  is OK since the blood stopped and I only had blood after urinating in that position as I felt discomfort and expected the blood could be because I injured myself, but the dr said they do not think so! he said as long as other tests are OK and there is no infection they need to check if there is any cancerous cells in the bladder as he think that could be the reason! I am very worry now, can not stop thinking that I might have cancer. I would appreciate any advise please. so if there is no infection what could the reason for bleeding after urinating? thanks 0 likes, 0 replies "
Substance Misuse,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/when-is-it-safe-to-take-an-advil-after-cocaine-use--690436,When is it safe to take an advil after cocaine use?,"Hi, So like an idiot, I tried cocaine for the first time this wednesday. We did not consume a huge amount. Probably around .1g for an entire night. I felt relatively fine after this with the exception of falling asleep much later. The day after we went out at night again but only at a bar and I only consumed 1 cocktail that night with no drugs. Then just yesterday we went out (again), this time to club. I drank 1 rome and coke and like an idiot consumed a very small amount of cocaine (2 small bumps for the entire night). I already had a weird voice the day before and now I think I caught the flu (which would make sens given were in the season here). So roughly 15 hours after my last small bump on cocaine, is it safe to take an advil for my flu? 0 likes, 2 replies "
Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recovery-time--743397,Recovery time?,"Hi all, On the 28 July I underwent a cystoscopy procedure due to a frequent urination problem that I have been dealing with since late last year. This was a flexible carried out using local anesthetic. I am very concerned that the procedure has caused damage to my prostate area. Prior to this I had no issues with my prostate, however since having the procedure done I feel as though the area has been ""bruised"" and with a dull ache around my lower back. The prostate itself was found to have no issue (i.e. it was not enlarged). Since having it done, I have not seen any blood so far, and have been drinking plenty of water. The hospital have only advised me to take painkillers if it gets too painful, and that the pain could take a week to subside. The part where the scope entered the prostate was pretty uncomfortable and I tensed up quite a bit while it was being done. The urologist had a good feel around. I suppose I am now concerned as to whether this pain will be permanent or if it will subside. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks 0 likes, 0 replies "

Sore Throat,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sore-throat-with-dysphagia-for-3-months-784443,Sore Throat with Dysphagia for 3 Months,"Hello. In February I started to notice some difficulty swallowing as well as some other worrying symptoms like weight loss. The difficulty swallowing is especially bad for dry foods like bread or chicken. Drinks are okay, saliva is very annoying though. I haven't choked yet but the best way I can describe it is that foods sticks sometimes and I need to swallow a few times to get it down. The area this is happening I guess would be around the Larynx/Hypopharanx area. In March I seen an ENT Consultant and I explained I was pretty worried about this so he did an Indirect Laryngoscopy and said everything appeared normal so he referred me for a Barium Swallow in April which again was reported as normal. At the start of May I had an Endoscopy (through the mouth) and again, everything was reported as normal with the exception of a Hiatal   and mild Oesophagitis. I have been prescribed PPIs (different to Omeprazole as I had already taken a 6 week course which did nothing) I guess they are suspecting LPR as I have had some acid erosion issues with my teeth in the past. Since then, the swallowing difficulties have remained about the same but I am also starting to develop a recurrent sore throat as well as what I can only describe as my ears feeling like they are blocked when I lay down at night, they return to normal when I get up and move around. Just going to be up front and honest, if this was something like Cancer would they have missed it between the Indirect Laryngoscopy, Endoscopy and Barium Swallow? Would appreciate any advice someone can give. 0 likes, 2 replies "

I initially got sick on Oct. 5th. It started with a terrible sore throat for the first day or two and then turned into a 101 degree fever, nasal congestion, chills, and body aches. I was pretty sick for about a week. I got tested for strep throat and Covid-19 twice throughout that week and they came back negative both times. Once I started feeling better, I noticed that I could feel something in the back of my throat when I swallow and my tonsils were still swollen. Using my phone light in the mirror I noticed a few bumps on the back of my throat as well (picture below). I have an appointment with an ENT but the soonest one I could get is still three weeks away. My primary care physician didn’t seem too worried about it, just said I should let her know if it gets any worse. They don't seem to have gotten worse but they aren't getting better. I got sick again Nov. 21 and have been sick since then. Similar symptoms to when I was sick a month before, with the exception of a more mild fever. I hadn't ever looked at my throat very close but I asked my doctor about the very pronounced red vessel in the back of my throat and she didn't seem think it was cause for concern.

It doesn't hurt when I swallow like a normal sore throat would, but it kind of has it's own little spasms of pain.  Let me describe these symptoms more specifically: Comes on and off, frequetly everyday.  It is located adjacent to my adam's apple, but further back.  (if you feel your adams apple, take two fingers and move more back, around your throat tract) and that's where the pain is.  The pain is like a little pinch.  It's tolerable, but it is incredibly annoying.  It mostly hurts on the left side. The pain is there no matter what my actions are.  If I talk, sneeze, blow my nose, yawn Somethings is pricking with sharp needle at edge of my Adams Apple. no swelling in my throat, swollen lymph nodes nor it is tight.  Rarely, I'll have to breathe deeper because of this. There is no swollen area from what I can tell.  So I'm wondering if this has anything to do with thyroid or lymph nodes? Maybe tonsils? Or throat   i dont know.  I'm not very educated about the throat. ALSO, I have NO cold symptoms, whatsoever. I am on anti biotics (amoxcyclin) for a week and ibuprofen 400mg for a week. No let-up from the sharp pinch and dull aching in the left side of the neck. I only have trouble with swallowing saliva when I sneeze, yawn, talk on the phone, burp or yawn. Normal drinking & eating food is fine. I also feel very dull pain in the left ear.

I get really bad razor bumps/ingrown hairs and razor burns no matter how much i exfoliate or use shaving cream. i haven't met another woman that has experienced this before, my friend says all she uses is shaving cream and a razor and doesn't get itchiness at all. to add onto this, I am very hairy and hair grows both a bit inside the labia majora and outside and sometimes reaches my thighs and stomach. I am a rape victim, but other than that one time i have never been sexually active. When i went to the Gynocologist for the first time,  i was tested for STDs, and got an examination, she didn't find anything wrong and gave me cream for the itchiness which didn't really help that much..

I was wrongly diagnosed with depression and 8wks ago was put on venlafaxine (Currently on 150mg). Saw a new psychiatrist who diagnosed Bi-polar 2 and started me on 100mg quetiapine MR to be taken for a week then up to 200mg for week and finally to 300mg.  He then wants to reduce the venlafaxine.  I've never been so ill. At one point I wanted to die as I have no proper feelings towards my beautiful daughter (12) or the rest of my family. I don't even feel like me.  I'm usually a very caring and compassionate person and feel totally lost and pretty scared most of the time.  My head is a scrambled mess, can't concentrate and don't enjoy anything and I even feel weird and mildly aggressive towards people that I love.  Memories from the past are coming up and I feel like I am reliving them as if they are happening now.  Wanted to know if this is normal with Bipolar 2. Have had overwhelming fear for weeks  and I'm so scared I will never feel like me again.  I feel disconnected from everyone and don't know how long I can cope. Would the antidepressant make my anxiety worse? I was put on it after what I know now was a hypomanic episode which was followed by the anxiety/fear.

Quetiapine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/3rd-week-off-of-quetiapine-the-insomnia-is-driving-me-crazy--610333,3rd week off of quetiapine - the insomnia is driving me crazy.,"I was prescribed 50 mg of Seroquel nightly for insomnia back in May. When I took it as prescribed that night, I was out for 10 hours straight. My husband says he got our dog on the bed and I didn't even react. I don't like sleeping with our 140 lbs Great Dane, so I usually tell him to get off the bed. Anyway, I had to go to work the next morning, and it was a nightmare. My speech was slurring, my hands were violently shaking, and I couldn't remember my co-workers names. On top of that, I was so drowsy, I became agitated about driving myself back home in that state. The drowsiness went away around 4 pm and at that point I was a crying mess, because I was so scared of the side effects. I contacted my doctor right away and she told me to cut the tablet in half and take it an hour earlier the following night, which I did and experienced a full blown insomnia where I maybe slept 2 hours in total. Since then, I had been taking 12.5mg - 25 mg on a nightly basis to help me sleep due to my anxiety issues. And for the first month or so, it did help. The drowsiness never went away, although it wasn't as acute. After about a month, things gradually went downhill. By the end of my "" treatment"" I had nights when I slept maybe 1 hour. After taking it, I would experience restless arms and legs, constant need to be moving, muscle twitching every 2 minutes and that was at 12.00am in the morning. I would stay up all night, and then have to go to work feeling like I want to crawl out of my skin. After coming to work, intense anxiety would overcome me and last a couple hours. I would start experiencing panic attacks, too. So I decided to stop Seroquel, as it was making my insomnia way worse than it was before. I am on my third week off of it and have the following   withdrawal symptoms: insomnia, intense muscle pain, headaches, diahrrea, irritability, and restlessness, depression. Paradoxically, my mind is clear and I have less anxiety. My question is: has anybody here successfully withdrawn from Seroquel, and if so how long did it take for this annoying insomnia to go away? I am also seeing a clinical psychologist, specifically for insomnia and anxiety. And she told me that the withdrawal symptoms shouldn't last more than 2 weeks. I can deal with any symptom, but the stupid insomnia. It's killing me to stare at the ceiling each night and be exhausted next morning. If anyone finds it helpful, here is my withdrawal timeline: Day 1: 4 hours of sleep, headaches, chills, hot flashes, diahrrea. Day 2: 8 hours of sleep on benadryl, anxiety. Day 3: benadryl stopped working, 2 hours of sleep, diahrrea. Day 4: 7 hours of broken sleep, anxiety. Day 5: 7 hours of broken sleep, intense depression,   thoughts. Day 6: 7 hour of broken sleep , anxiety, headaches. Day 7: 3 hours of sleep, diahrrea. Day 8: 7 hrs of sleep, depression, anxiety, muscle pain. Day 9: 4 hours of sleep, diahrrea. Days 10, 11, 12, 13,14: 7 hrs of light broken sleep and I don't complain, headaches. Day 15: 4 hours of sleep, diahrrea, depression, muscle pain. Day 16: 7 hours of somewhat solid sleep, muscle pain.

Quetiapine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/how-long-does-quetiapine-withdrawal-last--753608,How long does quetiapine withdrawal last? ,"Hi all, I was prescribed sertraline 100mg in January 2019.  I was still struggling a lot and the psychiatric consultant then prescribed quetiapine 50mg a day - 25mg in the morning and 25mg at night in September or October 2019 for 'agitation'. The main benefit I found was that it helped me sleep (which I really needed as my sleep was very erratic at the time and my experiene on   prior to that was very bad.) I also felt  like l dissociated less. Since being prescribed these two drugs,   I am not saying that the medication was completely responsible, as I had problems with binge eating and restricting before that time but I had always kept my weight in check despite that. I had to wonder did the increase in appetite, from the quetiapine in particular, I suspect, exacerbate my binge eating habit. Also, the timing of the   since being put on the medication, makes me think it couldn't have simply coincidence to have the weight gain start so soon after going on these drugs, as it is a listed side effect of both. Anyways, I got sick and tired of the weight gain. My weight was just increasing and increasing and I found I was sleeping for 12-13 hours, one time even 16 hours in one stretch if I remember correctly, as well as sometimes napping for a couple of hours during the day. I came off my sertraline starting in September, in consultation with my psychiatrist. He didn't think it was the best time for me but I told him, 'If you don't tell me how to wean off, I'm going to wean off myself'. My suicidal ideation and planning reached its worst but I also had other things going on at that time, so I am not absolutely certain it was as a result of coming off the sertraline. Since then, I started Dialectical Behaviour Therapy . My suicidal ideation has reduced to being nearly completely absent, my negative emotions have decreased and I have found more joy, overall. All this, until after Christmas. . . **At my last psychiatry appointment on the 14th December, I asked to come off the quetiapine. The psychiatrist once again seemed reluctant but I explained how much I was over-sleeping, so he said I could try two days off the morning dose and see how I felt and if I felt OK to continue. So I did. We had agreed I would wait to talk about stopping the night-time dose at my next appointment on March 15th. I guess I just got sick of waiting and having felt absolutely fine after dropping down to just the night-time dose, I thought it would be fine to stop taking the night-time dose as well. ** **I had skipped a couple of doses the week before last and noticed some tearfulness and thought nothing of it. Then I stopped taking it properly and continuously on Sunday 10th - so I have been 6 nights off it. I have noticed I have felt quite low and I am very tearful. 2 things came up this were difficult but I still feel like I am unusually tearful, even though those things are going on. Once I start to talk to anyone on the phone, I start blubbering. My motivation has decreased. I have also been having gas, nausea,   and some dizziness at times. It is quite unpleasant. I am particularly concerned about the tearfulness/feeling low because I don't want that to be permanent or lasting effect. I don't want to spiral downwards again because I was doing quite well. I am also feeling a bit isolated and worried because I did this despite the psychiatrist's advice to take it slower and discuss again at the next appointment . . .  I am questioning whether I should continue on ceasing to take this, or whether I should consider going back to the night-time dose.  ** Has anyone else gone through similar side effects? How did you wean off? And if you did experience similar withdrawal symptoms, how long did it last please? I thought it was such a low dose that it wouldn't affect me but it looks like I guessed wrong. I seem to have quite bad experiences in general coming off these types of medications from past experience. 😢 0 likes, 1 reply "
Quetiapine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/drastic-weight-gain-in-stomach-only-after-only-two-weeks-of-taking-50mg-587222,Drastic weight gain in stomach only after only two weeks of taking 50mg,"I am a small person. I am 5'4 and typically around 115 pounds.  My doctor perscribed 50 mg, which I took for a week (to augment sertraline).  I felt great and mentally healthy for the first time in a while (placebo maybe...not sure when it actually takes effect but we readjusted other meds which could perhaps me the reason). In short at about day three of taking my 50 mg I was getting dressed and noticed a huge bulge in my abdominal area.  I chalked it up to menstruation.  However at  day five, my assistant at work (who I am very close with) asked if I was expecting. I looked down and realized I legit looked pregnant.  I thought perhaps it was an initial side effect that would go away so I took it for two more days and at that point I looked ready to go into labor. I immediately called my doctor, who told me to stop taking the medicince and tha it had not been long enough that a taper would be needed. It has now been two months and although my stomache has gone down somewhat it is still disproportionate to my body.  I have been wearing baggy shirts because my mid section does not match my arms and legs. I eat very well and exercise regular and typically have a very flat stomache.  I competed in college gymnastics.  I did not change diet or exercise when taking the medication. I just need some advice on how to make my stomache look normal again, the way it did the week before the quetiapine.  It's harming my self esteem and sex life and casuing obsessive thoughts of it never going away.  Again, advice or peaceof mind would be very very much appreciated. 0 likes, 6 replies "

I have quit and relapsed so many times I've lost count.   I am currently abusing Codeine, Dihydrocodeine and Tramadol and its getting worse and worse.  I've also been hiding it from my wife again, which I don't know why I do as she can tell I am using and I lie to her face and say ""No i am not"". So it all came to head a few weeks back and she says ""you need help"", so I went back to CGL and registered with them.  This time it was much quicker and I have just seen their Doctor who has put me on an Espranor(Buprenorphine) treatment plan which I will start on Friday morning. I am to stop taking opiates tomorrow so i go at least 24hrs into withdrawals so I don't go into precipitated withdrawal, which is unbelievably nasty so I've read. Not looking forward to the experiencing withdrawals but I think there is now some light at the end of tunnel for this, finally. I have tried all sorts to stop using but nothing seemed to work and I would just relapse, so this is really the last option I think apart from going into rehab for 28 days which I can not afford. (its like £10k !!!). At first the Doctor wasn't sure if buprenorphine would be suited for me but by the time I'd explained everything I do he changed his mind and agreed it was the best option. So I start on 4mg daily and see how it goes, if thats not enough then he will up it to 8mg Daily. When I left the appt I felt a wave of relief, that something had changed and I dont have to drive around 10 pharmacies a day buying pills and cough linctus.  I allso buy them online which costs a fortune and you never know what your getting.... So I'm hoping that this will the start of a new page for me and my family and that we can start rebuilding what I have destroyed over the past 7 years. Trent 0 likes, 0 replies "

Venlafaxine,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/venlafaxine-withdrawal-755775,Venlafaxine withdrawal ,"Hi. I had been on venlafaxine for 1 year, prior to this I was on sertraline for 7 years. I found the sertraline was not effective anymore for my OCD (intrusive thoughts) so I went to see my psychiatrist and he put me on 75mg of venlafaxine. My plan was to always try and come off the venlafaxine at the end of year and see how I go without medication. December 2020 came so I went to see my psychiatrist, he told me that as I was only on 75mg of venlafaxine, it was a low dose and I could just stop the medication. I may feel a bit foggy and off for a few weeks but nothing else. Off I went and listened to the doctors advice as he knows what he is talking about. After day 3 of stopping, I felt awful. I had every single withdrawel symptom and couldnt stop crying. I rang the psychiatrist and he told me that I was clearly just very sensitive and to go back on the medication but to 37.5mg and try to come off again when I felt ready. Within 2 hours of taking the tablet I felt better and the withdrawals had gone. I then realised how powerful this drug was! in january 2021, I decided to try again to come off but have done it with the GPs help.  The plan was to take a tablet every other day for 2 weeks, then a tablet every 2 days for 2 weeks, then every 3 days for 2 weeks. I have just started every 4 days for 2 weeks. I can honestly say this s**t is hard. I have done a lot of research on the withdrawals and alot of people have said to take fish oil and magnesium to help. I do believe they are helping. I am hoping by mid march I will be off this drug. My concern is, how long will the withdrawals last for once I have stopped completely?.  Will I feel back to me again or is my brain 'damaged' now from this drug? I would never have touched this medication if I knew how difficult it was to come off.  Just wish the doctor would have explained this all to me before I started going on it. Yes it did help with my OCD however I am sure other medication would have aswell. I wish everyone luck who is going through this withdrawal journey! 0 likes, 1 reply "

I have finally kicked my 17 year old son out of the family home.  I have had enough of his house & car wrecking, of having to replace or repair items.  And the cause of this behaviour - 2 years of smoking CANNABIS. He does not work or go to college.  He has no ambition and thinks the world owes him a living.  He refuses to believe that he is ever wrong about anything, and that all the problems he has are of my making.  His favourite excuse is that I was never at home for him (I have worked full time since he was 9 months old and have brought him up on my own since he was 2 years old). If this can help just one other parent, then this will not be in vain.  Please don't make the same mistakes I have made.  If your child's behaviour changes suddenly, don't just put it down to being a teenager - there could be another cause.  If your child sells their belongings, 'because I don't use/need it any more' when you know they still utilise the item, please think 'Why are they doing this?' My son was a happy 15 year old, looking forward to the rest of his life, wanting to become a fighter pilot or mechanic.  He is now an unhappy 17 year old with no belongings apart from his clothes, a criminal record and, at present, no future that I can see. I have thrown him out after he damaged my car because I wouldn't give him money the second he wanted it, as I have stupidly done in the past.  I can now (belatedly) see that I should have stopped funding him months ago and forced him to stand on his own two feet.  I just hope it is not too late.

I've been struggling with continually shifting moods due to Bipolar disorder with Mixed and psychotic features for about a year and had no access to the CMHT... I kept on being told ""I wasn't ill enough"" Don't you just hate that line. but, in February they finally decided they need to get me some treatment. First thing on the list was a doubling of my Venlafaxine from 150mg to 300mg. Within 48 hours I found myself in my local urology urgent treatment centre being catheterised having found that I had 1.8l of urine in my bladder. None of the staff there had any idea what was happening and just sent me home with the catheter and bags. I had a cystoscopy 4 weeks later which showed no narrowing/swelling and in generally good condition. I mentioned the change in Venlafaxine to the specialist and he hummed and argued, and decided he would do a Trial without catheter.  He pumped a litre of water in and left me sitting there for 2 hours. Absolutely nothing happened... so in went another catheter. I now have another TWOC  a week Monday, which, if I fail, will lead to intermittent catheter training, but, again no one is explaining a) what is happening, b) why it's happening  and c) what they're going to do about it? Sorry I've splurged, but I wanted to be clear... Can anyone else relate to this or provide me with any guidance? Thank you x 0 likes, 1 reply "

She's constantly thinking we are talking about her, says she hears us in her head. I cant watch tv cuz she says there's subliminal messages to her in the shows. Her violent behaviour is only verbal and once she threw water in my face, and its only when I bring up the subject of dope. The list goes on. Ive researched Meth Psychosis and they say a childhood trauma is usually the cause, she went through one involving CPS. Also suggests genes are involved, her father was on drugs for years and I never understood his way out thinking, Meth Psychosis explains it. Since she wont seek help, I have to wait until she is suicidal or a danger to herself before I can call the police, explain her situation and hopefully they will take her directly to mental facility, by then it could be too late and she'll have schizophrenia and wont come back from after recovery from drugs. Not all addicts get this way although they say after many years of drug abuse they will, I believe they all go through episodes but only those with underlying cause become psychotic. This happened to my daughter instantly. I was on meth in my younger years and never experienced such a thing. If you or a loved one suffers from addiction, research Meth Psychosis. Its important to understand it and how to communicate with them is very important, for both of you. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Before starting  , I was one of those people whose weight never fluctuated by more than 5 lbs at most- I'd consistently been the same weight from my mid teens. Started sertraline 2 years ago- no  , but it wasn't effective. Switched to citalopram after a few months, and that was where the weight gain gradually started, although my diet was pretty much the same. However, it was when I changed to venlafaxine that it really started to go up. In about 1.5 years, I've gained 2 stone. I don't look or feel myself anymore, my clothes don't fit, and whilst the venlafaxine is really helping, this weight gain is getting to me a lot. I did a BMI check this morning and for or the first time ever, I'm now at 25, in the overweight category. I know I can't completely attribute it to the medication, as I also used to run a lot and haven't kept this up regularly over the past year. However, there were previously periods where I'd stopped running for a month or two and my weight wouldn't change at all. I've mentioned it to my CPN who insists it's not the medication.

I have ruled out fat given the above, the only two possibilities left are some kind of water retention (even with salt restriction doesn't improve), or else that the effexor has effected the firmness (collagen?) of the skin making it extremely loose and soggy, and also effecting the firmness of the organs or the fascia and connecting tissue holding them in place. I have been off the medication for 3.5 months now without any improvement. an ultrasound of the upper abdomen didn't show up anything suspect on the organs scanned. I am now leaning toward thinking the collagen or some other compound involved in keeping the skin/connective tissue/organs firm is responsible, although this is probably the worse outcome it makes a lot of sense, as both skin + gut issue I don't think it can rationally be a coincidence. if anyone has any advice on who to see or what to do that would be gladly appreciated, or anyone who may have similar experiences who wants to chime in 0 likes, 7 replies "

In the proceeding months this year my drinking really degenerated, 13-15 cans of cider or beer daily with only 1 meal and as far as medication I took thiamine as most alcoholics do. I started getting symptoms such as insomnia (which meant 24-36 hour alcohol binges), breathlessness and sleep apnea, deeply disturbed sleep and awakings  i cant even put into words, pins and needles, pain and numbness in my back, neck, limbs, chest and sometimes head which felt like a very constricted heavy feeling like poor circulation and a pain in my foot (same feeling but much worse). I know when drinking goes to far and its time to stop or die and in honesty I could feel the malnurtion coming but these symptoms were new to me and i believed they were related to smoking as i gained an intolarence to it for some reason and everytime i smoked (25-35 a day idk) those symptoms paticularly the breathlessness and that horrible numb feeling in my body came on. I seeked help from a gp who got me connected with local drug sevices and a blood specialist as it turned out i had a high red blood cell count. Now fast foward to 3 weeks ago things were beyond worse the pain in my foot became the pain in my legs and ankles too, I would constantly gasp for air frantically and was so breathless i routinly sat infront of a pedestal fan to feel more oxygenated, and whats worse I started cognitivitly deteriorating, memory loss, loopy thoughts, inablility to understand and process information (temporary phase but i was generally slow and by this point not myself) very confusing dementia like phases spending hours trying to write my symptoms down (to show a doctor) and failing, a feeling of intense restlessness, anxiety and apathy all i did everyday was walk around the house and chew pillows (i have aspergers i was stimming i guess) and my executive functioning skills were barely managable , the insomnia was bad i stupidly took some diazapam ome morning to give myself a break from the alcohol (not my diazapam) for the sake of survival, I had to cut down on smoking to prevent the constricted feeling oh and i forgot to say i vomit daily at night there was now blood in it and all of this distressed and upset me greatly as I was waiting for a detox and a local clinic but theres a waiting list. But thankfully I went to hospital out of desperation and to my bewilderment they gave me a detox and pumped me full of sodium as my levels were low, i gained my appatite back i wasnt 100% but i felt so relieved my symptoms subsided as i was on nicotine patches during my stay (8 hour sodium drip and many banana drips). Longstory short came home and enjoyed days of soberity and was cigarette free as i started vaping i felt great and got huge 11 hour sleeps and ate like a grizzly bear, had regular bowel movements that werent tarry black, I felt a great sense of wellbeing for the future, my legs were still sore but not when i vaped or drank caffinated drinks (subsititute) Now 1 week after i went to hosptial things took a downturn, the vape started making me breathless and gasping for air so i switched to patches which stopped the problem but i caved and vaped again and now the restlessness and anxiety that cranked up 24/7 feeling is back, my cognition gradually over the days starts to get bad again and worse theres phases of literal dementia id say with slurred speech and all the symptoms of impairment and a weird which of  are just phases bit sometimes very seizure like deja vu like, i went to a doctor for bloods to see what was up and i literally forgot everything my memory and recollection is so bad, the numbness and constricted feeling all of the symptoms really are back and worse. The bouts of dementia like symptoms come with panic attacks and phases of breathlessness, the numbness and pain seems to be a circulation thing i dont understand the pain and feeling subsides when my blood pressure is high but in rare calm phases where i dont move the pain and weakness comes on, ive been having fevers aswell and honestly this entire week has been the worse of my life ive told mh family i live them several times because i feel this is it, ive taken measures to try and stop symptoms and im too confused to understand them as all of them are so unpredictiable one day this helps the next day it doesnt. ive been to hospital today and the day before first to get my bloods (as the gp was taking too long) and get examined and according to them its anxiety!!!! im literally suffering physically and mentally here im basically the same as i was when i was drinking and smoking, the worst symptom of all is the apathy which is back i care so little about anything i wasnt even relieved the ultrasound showed i didnt have cirrohos, people and places give me no vibe or feeling and i dont recognise them, music, tv shows food nothing im an empty vessel running on muscle memory i dont want to speak to anyone i geel like a soicopath, i cant physically work the length of myself without feeling like im going to collapse or have an ""episode"", ive been drinking fizzy drinks like cans of cider to they amp me up but make me more agaitated Ive lost my appatite and my stomach is messed up and could be a major culprit in this now i vomited for the first time tonight as if i were still drinking food digests so quickly and i dont have proper bowel movements anymore just dierrea everytime i eat, when it comes to eating i have to force feed myself because the food sustains me and gets rid of some symptoms for a few hours, ive barely slept in 3 days now including this night its 2 in the morning im not feeling like i will sleep, the breathlessness (my lungs are fine apparently everything is fine apparently) and gasping for air (which happens mainly if i havent eaten in awhile) has gotten so much worse i have periods aswell where i dont breath much at all i wonder if this is the reason for the impairment of my mind rather than brain damage from the alcohol, my body is so uncomfortable and sore,  ive to speak to my cpn tomorrow (about anxiety management it could open doors for medication and support) 88i just dont know what to say or do im so confused on top of all of this I just have this horrific feeling inside its all so confusing. I havent told you the full story and all the details its just too much but what do you think is up with me? im i one of those alcoholics thats basically dead but the alcohol was keeping them alive?

Secondly, it's only my 3rd day on the reduced dose and I feel flat energy-wise like I'm having to drag myself around and also a bit despondent. Maybe it's psychosomatic.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/what-is-this-feeling-exactly--666594,What is this feeling exactly?,"So I don’t actually have a fibro diagnosis, but most of us on here know that a diagnosis and/or understanding of fibromyalgia is ambiguous at best. Whatever I am experiencing seems to be most similar to this or cfs or the like. The problem I am having is describing my symptoms. I usually just default to saying “weird sensations”. I can’t seem to find the words to explain it. Tingling isn’t quite right, burning seems a little off and itching isn’t exactly it... its like all three of those. Then you add in the feeling of blood rushing or skin crawling or pressure and numbness. When I try to explain this to anyone, especially doctors, their eyes glaze over. If I were in their shoes I’m certain I would so the same.  Is this what other people experience? I hear a lot of stories of pain, but what about this tingly/burny/bloodrushy/skin crawly/itchy stuff? How do I get a doctor to take that seriously?? 0 likes, 7 replies "

I have given up on ever finding relief, let alone a cure, but during a mandatory review of my medication. the doc suggested moving from sertraline to duloxetine. nothing to lose, I thought I'd give it a go. I can't think positively about it or I'll end up down in a very dark place if (when) it doesn't help. Does anyone have experience of the switch between these meds? Was it worthwhile?

Fibromyalgia Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-twitchy-eye-warning-sign-656514,My Twitchy Eye Warning Sign,"Hi All I've been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, CFS/ME, IBS and  , after extensive investigations and tests into my symptoms with no apparent reason being found for them. For the last 2 weeks I had been feeling really quite well for a change, considering normally there is usually an almost constant feeling of being ill and groggy, well that was until a couple of days ago. There is one thing I have noticed that I wanted to share with you all about when my condition(s) flare up. Well, the day before yesterday I woke feeling fine, until the evening when I noticed my left eye starting to randomly twitch, spasm and feel lumpy, but it looked fine. A little while after that I started to feel a bit ill, but nothing drastic, but I did think to myself before bed that I was going to start having a flare up tomorrow, my left eye still twitching away randomly. Low and behold I woke up yesterday and felt awful, I felt faint and unsteady like I am on a boat, breathing was laboured, my whole body seemed to ache and be in pain all over, particularly my legs, my stomach and bowels were churning and gurgling a lot, and I felt nauseous and bloated, and I generally felt awful, all the time my left eye still randomly twitching, spasming and feeling lumpy, and today I'm much the same as yesterday. I have noticed that when I've gone through these flare ups in the past I have noticed I always get the left eye twitch, spasm, lumpy feeling, the right eye is fine, it's always just the left one. I have now taken this eye twitching experiencing as my first warning sign that a flare up is on the way, and I was wondering if any other Fibromyalgia sufferers experience the same, or have their own warning signs? As I've said I've had extensive testing done, one test being a head  , and as I said everything has always been fine. I'd be interested to know what you all think of my findings, whether you think the left eye twitch is indeed a sign of a flare up and if any of you experience anything similar to me.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/elevated-ck-levels-should-i-be-worried--481634,Elevated CK levels... should I be worried???,"So I went to the ER yesterday, bc since Friday I have not been able to stand up for more than 10-15 minutes without getting so tired or light headed that i need to lie down. I have had off and on mild nausea and bad muscle aches in my back, stomach, and chest. The doctor did bloodwork which showed my CK level to be at 687 (normal is between 17-170). She said your levels could register high after a vigorous workout, but seeing as I have spent the last 3 days in bed, that wasnt normal. She said she wasnt offically ""diagnosising me"", but referring me to a rhemotologist to look into the possibility of muscular dystrophy. Now I am kind of freaking out. I wasnt expecting that. I am a 33 year-old avid athlete. I have chronic muscle pains, but usually its always in the back, chest, stomach, or neck area... rarely my limbs.  There never said what was causing my sudden lack of energy, light-headedness, and nausea. They said it could just be a virus but there was no way to tell and just sent me home. However, the possibility of having Muscular Dystrophy has me shaken. It sent me into a research mode while I wait for my specialist appointment next week. I have found various causes for elevated CK levels- * Heart Issues * Muscular Diseases * Tyroid Problems * A Virus * Vitamin D or B12 Deficiencies Obviously, I am hoping for 1 of the later 2. The CK levels and my chronic muscle pains are the only thing leading her to suggest the possiblity of Muscular Dystrophy. Of course, it's not easy to put your mind at ease when you hear that. Has anyone else on here expeirenced high CK levels before and know more about it? Is it possible that I just have a virus that has made me sick and weak the past week or so that is causing the muscle pain and CK level readings? Could it be something else? Any input from someone who knows more about it than I do would be much appreciated. Thank You.   1 like, 37 replies "

This happens when cutting food, holding down a button on my phone to leave a voice message, brushing teeth etc. I can reproduce twitching by exerting a muscle, for instance, pursing my eyes shut will lead to eye twitching, continuing for a minute thereafter.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anyone-with-similar-symptoms--773346,Anyone with similar symptoms?,"Hi , I am a 25 year old female that has developed some odd symptoms over the last 4 months. I think it is worth mentioning that this has been a very stressful year for me (personal and family issues) and I believe that it is possible all that stress may have set this all off. It all started as a pressure type feeling on my left rib cage. Felt like a pulled muscle and bothered me ever so slightly. When it didn't go away after a few weeks I became worried and started googling and gave myself terrible health anxiety. After a month of the ""fullness"" it turned into quick jabs, mild pains, that would move around the left ribs, sometimes on sternum too. I was convinced  I had some type of bone  . I got more upset when it moved to my right ribs too. Again quick jabs that would jump around the ribs or sometimes a feeling of pressure on the ribs and also burning at times. Over the last month or so a slew of other symptoms have started. I have back aches/pains that move up the left side middle of back and down to my hips (this lasted for several weeks). It has now seemed to mostly shift to my upper back across on both sides. It's an achy feeling. My spine is tender in a couple spots and I also have recently started to feel twitching in the muscles between the ribs, on my sides, and random muscle twitches all over abdomen and in the back where the aches and tension spots are. I went to get a deep tissue massage for my back and it felt SO good. The woman said my back was horribly tight and I have muscle knots in my back. I work a stressful desk job and I believe I tense up a lot and I never had good posture (working on that). I also have aches in my thighs, knees, calves, ankles usually only in the morning, after waking it eases as i move around. I now noticed this intermittent tingling sensation in my left fingers and left foot/ankle. I get random neck aches and  , usually left but sometimes right too. It seems like all this discomfort is migrating rather than radiating if that makes sense. I.E. when i have the upper back aches, I don't feel the middle back aches. I also have IBS type symptoms with all of this but could be from my  ... aka occasional cramping in left colon area from ribs to ovary area and I am either constipated or I have to go NOW lol... stool is brown and soft. My upper abdominal muscles feel sore/tender like I've been doing sit ups even though i havent done a sit up since high school gym class lol... I know this is a lot of info... does anyone relate to this at all? I have had 3 x-rays, a CT scan with contrast of my abdomen and pelvis (small   found), abdominal ultrasound, and lots of blood work. Nothing has been found.   coming in early Nov. I go back and forth between this being muscular/nerve related or GI related but honestly think both could be at play here? Good news is I feel great besides the every day aches and pains, like my energy is good and I feel overall healthy. I initially lost around 7 lbs when this started bc of my nerves but now that i am eating normally again I have gained it all back.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/anybody-with-fm-get-muscle-twitches-fasciculations--544948,anybody with FM get muscle twitches (fasciculations)?,"Hi, I've only been posting on these boards for a week or so. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. This is mainly for people who already have a fibromyalgia diagnosis and don't have any other known conditions that could be causing symptoms. First, a bit about me. I've been healthy all my life, with very little to complain about. I went through a very rough time earlier this year, with chronic stress, a major loss, and decreased nutrition and sleep. About 6 months ago I started having pain all over, often for no good reason, and sometimes the pain came and went. It was in muscles, joints, and felt like it was running up and down my arms and legs. My feet became sensitive and painful, so that after standing for just a few seconds, I had to sit back down... but then my butt got sore from sitting, and so on. I also stopped being able to sleep well, my heart rate went up, my mood went down, my memory and concentration got impaired, I felt clumsy, I lost weight despite eating very well, I got heart palpitations, bladder symptoms, IBS, muscle twitches all over, and I was extremely fatigued from the smallest things like brushing my teeth. The ER found nothing wrong with my heart, but their limited tests didn't do much to reassure me. My GP brushed me off for the most part. A neurologist did an EMG (needle probe in my muscles) and noted the muscle twitches but said he saw no evidence of neurological disorder. He told me to get my stress level down. Ironically, that stressed me out, as I could tell SOMETHING was wrong, and everybody was just telling me to chill out. As far as bloodwork, my thyroid is putting out a fair bit of T3 and T4, and my TSH is low but not low enough for a diagnosis. My TPOab is about 10 (despite being on a gluten-free diet). My blood sugar and cholesterol tends to be on the high side, perhaps pre-diabetes, but also not enough for diagnosis. Electrolytes are normal, red blood cells are a bit down, and there was no evidence of antibodies indicating lupus, Sjorgens, or connective tissue diseases. My B12 is normal. I'm negative for H Pylori, Lyme, Hep, and a few other nasty bugs. Without much help from doctors, I've done a lot of research. I take Magnesium citrate and vitamins B, C, and D. I use acetaminiphen and ibuprofen for pain relief, just enough to take the edge off. Ashwaganda root powder before bed helps me sleep, and it's good for overall stress levels as well. I get a little bit of moderate exercise every day, careful not to push it, or I end up in worse pain and have to take a couple days to recover. My diet has improved greatly. I'm vegan (plus free range eggs), almost totally organic, gluten-free, and very little processed food or sugar. I'm a little better than I was at the worst point, which was July and August. I need a little less pain meds, I'm sleeping a bit more at night, my energy level is quite improved (but still not normal), my mood is better, and my heart rate isn't as fast. I'm slowly gaining a little bit of the weight back. I still have some fatigue, some trouble sleeping, some anxiety, some bladder symptoms, some brain fog, and the muscle twitches continue unchanged. My question is about muscle twitches (fasciculations). Do you also get them, and if so, what are they like? Mine are quick contractions of just part of a muscle, and can happen anywhere on my body. Anywhere I could contract a muscle voluntarily, a twitch can happen there. Some places seem to be ""favourites"" (like calves, under my eyes, shoulders) but they all end up twitching at some point. Sometimes they'll be quiet for a few minutes, sometimes I have about 1 per second. Sometimes the same muscle will repeat for a few minutes (or hours), other times it's totally random and spread out. They SEEM to be a little worse when I'm more stressed out or tired, but it's hard to be certain. Sometimes they're large and pronounced, other times they're smaller and faster, like a vibration. When in my fingers or thumb, they often come across as a hand tremor, which is unpleasant. Sometimes they keep me up, or wake me up too early. I've read fasciculations are a part of Fibromyalgia, and I've also read that they aren't. In the absense of quality medical attention, or even a confirmed diagnosis, I'm left wondering if I've got FM, or something else (like a neurological disorder). If you have FM, and nothing else that would cause fasciculations, could you please tell me about them? Thank you!  0 likes, 17 replies "

am i a normal person having a drink to unwind once or twice a week or an alcoholic? i don't see my friends anymore because she spoils events and starts fights. it's always someone elses fault according to her but she is the common factor. she says WE need to find a way to stop this but i don't usually get angry. twice a year maybe. she gets angry twice a week and at least once a month it's a screaming hysterical fit. i'm trying my best to keep the house clean, and it IS a mess. but equally i've been ill too and still feeding everyone. not to mention she has inherited some OCD level victorian cleanliness mania from her mother who is the type to throw sealed salad out if it is put beside sealed raw meat in the fridge. i don't know what i expect to achieve posting here. i keep a list of phrases to avoid. like i don't tell the boys ""i've got cookies or apples for your snack tonight"". i have to say ""we've got"" or it is assumed i am trying to make her feel guilty. again, am i being inconsiderate? or just using a turn of phrase without thinking? but even with all that preventative stuff occasionally she is, to my mind, so cruel and vindictive that i just lose my temper. and then of course it's all pent up and it comes out. and then on her part it is never forgotten. i'm pretty sure i'm being supportive generally and she is just being unreasonable about most things, and only because of the mood swings and pain. but she can just go back to bed now. i've still got to work a full day, and try and tidy to a level that will stop her frustration. but my work requires high concentration and i am shaking and crying. i rarely get more than 7 minutes uninterrupted. so i work late to get quiet time. then i'm up early. so i like to rest 10am-12pm and catch up on sleep. which she just can't get on board with. she thinks i'm hungover, or lazy, or she is just frustrated like this morning so she never lets me sleep. i bought the vodka because on mondays i technically play games online with my brothers who live abroad. i was going to play tonight and have a drink. it is literally the only social thing i do. but she at least 50% of the time causes a fight or otherwise makes sure it doesn't happen. as i say, not sure what i hope to achieve bu this aside from writing it all down to help me calm down a bit. i can't talk to anybody about it all on the phone. she listens in. 0 likes, 1 reply "
Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/female-flexible-cystoscopy-experience-25974,FEMALE FLEXIBLE CYSTOSCOPY EXPERIENCE,"I wanted to write about my experience of flexible cystoscopy, as when I was going to have mine, I found very little information about the experience for women, and it was worrying. I hope this is helpful to others! In my case I had been having really pesistent, severe and regular urinary infections for about three years (I'm 20 now, and I would have them nearly monthly, about 10 in the past year), so this is why they (eventually) suggested the procedure in conjunction with an  . Let me start by telling you this; the waiting and worrying IS the worst part, at least in my experience. It seems like it's going to be the worst thing in the world and is incredibly nerve wracking, but the procedure was painless. After booking in and going through details, I was asked to change into a gown with bottom half garments removed, then waited in a specific room. When I was called in the doctor (a male doctor, I thought I would be phased by this but I wasn't as he was so nice) went through my details quickly, and explained the procedure fully, took the time to answer any questions, and made sure I was at ease. I would say that feeling at ease doctor was a big part of why this went so smoothly. I didn't feel embarrassed or upset as I thought I would be. If your doctor specifically is making you feel uneasy or won't make sure if you have questions, are aware of what's going on etc, it could make things more difficult. It's up to you if you want to go through with the procedure or not in this case, be sensible about it (try not to confuse this with plain nerves), but remember that you do have the choice to stop/organise it again with another doctor if you feel really uncomfortable with the person. OK, so they put a cloth over you with a hole in it, clean you up and then apply some anaesthetic to the urethra with a syringe (without a needle). This felt cold but was painless. Very soon after the scope is inserted. In my case this didn't hurt, at all. I could feel it, but it was only mild discomfort, not even amounting to the typical discomfort of a urinary infection. I could feel it most when it was rotated (to look all around the bladder), that was slightly more uncomfortable but I wouldn't really say it was painful. The scope took about a minute, the whole process took about 10 minutes or under I would say.  Afterwards it was explained that I could have some minor bleeding and pain passing water and I could develop a urinary infection (I was given a prescription just in case). Afterwards I did have mild bleeding for 2-3 days and some discomfort for about the same amount of time, no worse than an average UTI I'd say. This could vary from person to person, so try and take some time off to rest if it's very uncomfortable. Waiting and worrying about it was definately the worst thing about the experience. I don't think many people can truly be at ease with this sort of thing, if I had another I would probably still have a few nerves. Just make sure you get any questions answered and ask your doctor to explain what he's doing as he's doing it if that would help you. In my case they didn't find anything wrong, but I was glad to have had it done and eliminate the possibility. Now I'm on prophylactic   - I take an antibiotic every night, and it seems to have worked so far  Hope that helps any other women having this procedure to know a bit more about the experience! 2 likes, 3 replies "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/female-cystostopy-763879,Female cystostopy,"This may not totally set your mind at rest. The doctor assured me that mine was one of the hardest she'd done in a while, less than 1 in a hundred people. In terms of reassurance it only hurt for a few seconds. However the normal timing of about five minutes did not apply to me. It took 45 minutes or so because she was unable to locate the opening. It was very hard to find which is apparently unusual especially in someone of my age. We changed position three times, tried finding it with a guide wire instead and had to add more numbing gel three times - perhaps that's why it didn't hurt! The doctor left the room once to find a guide wire and one of the nurses was in and out like a yo-yo but there was a screen between me and the door. When the water was added the need to urinate was insane, I think I was still dripping when I raced to the toilet afterwards. I was still wearing just a towel on my lower half at that point and I did have to walk down the corridor like that. I could have been dressed by then but the excessive amount of water used during the procedure meant that my, tucked out of the way, skirt was soaking wet as were my socks. I felt like I was peeing razor blades for about six hours after I left with a small amount of bleeding. I think that I was pretty rare, the looks on all three people's faces told me that they were surprised and not just saying so. My bladder is apparently in great health though and the pain was only momentary on the the camera was inserted. Fortunately I don't embarrass very easily but I think a lot of people would have felt very self-conscious with the time spent lying with their legs open. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/flexible-cystoscopy-male--34531,Flexible cystoscopy (male),"I'm a 36 y/o male and underwent a flexible   last week. Thought I'd register with this forum just to share my experience with other chaps who might be worried about the procedure. Once you're prepped and ready to receive the cystoscope, the procedure, itself, lasts probably around 5 minutes, or so. The cystoscope is approximately the thickness of a pencil with a rounded end containing a flashing light. The first step involves disinfecting the area around the genitals... just a few dabs/wipes of antiseptic. This is followed by an injection of anaesthetic gel into the urethra (pee hole). The gel is injected from a syringe with no needle attached. The surgeon injects the gel with a fairly quick firm push on the syringe plunger and this feels weird and a bit uncomfortable (but not painful). The anaesthetic does sting slightly as it goes in, but it's not what I'd call painful, as such... just pretty uncomfortable for a few seconds. In my case, the surgeon left no real time for the anaesthetic to 'work' and proceeded straight away. As it happens, the cystoscope was somewhat tangled-up and he spent about 30 seconds to a minute dealing with (which I was quietly thankful for as it probably gave a little more time for the anaesthetic to take effect). Usually, I watch needles going in and am not squirmish about things being done to me but, in this case, I had no desire to watch the cystoscope going in! Instead, I focused by attention on the video monitor, which kinda detaches you from the experience somehow. Although I could feel the cystoscope going in, I didn't feel any pain or discomfort... until the scope reached the area of the prostate. If you're having this procedure, it's likely you have possible prostate trouble and, as most   involve enlargement of the prostate, the urethra will be narrowed at this point depending on how enlarged the prostate is. I suspect how much discomfort/pain you feel at this point of the procedure will depend on how enlarged your prostate is and how much it occludes the urethra. In my case, the urethra was very narrowed as the median lobe of my prostate is enlarged (the source of my symptoms). The surgeon paused at this point and asked me to relax as though I was trying to urinate. I tried to do this, but as soon as the scope moves forwards, you naturally tense-up, which defeats the object of trying to relax in the first place! This was the most uncomfortable/painful part of the whole procedure for me. The pain was enough for me to screw my eyes up and shout 'owww' a few times, but it wasn't unbearable and only lasted a few seconds until the scope had passed the narrowing. After this, the scope enters the bladder and the surgeon has a good look around... you cannot feel this at all. In my case, my bladder was then filled with 400ml of water through the cystoscope as I was to have a flow study conducted immediately afterwards. When the cystoscope comes out, it's a very strange feeling as you feel a bit like you're urinating (but you're not, obviously), but it's not painful. For me, the after-effects were minimal... I was anxious about urinating afterwards, but it wasn't too bad at all... some slight stinging the first couple of times, but that was all. Certainly no need for pain-killers. All in all, the flexible cystoscopy wasn't too bad for me. It's not an experience I'd be in a rush to repeat(!), but it needed doing and it didn't last too long. I'd say it's no worse, really, than having something like a root canal at the dentist (which I've also experienced). Uncomfortable with the occasional fleeting bit of pain, but nothing too major.

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-cystoscopy-experience-with-bladder-biopsy-for-urinary-hesitancy-756568, My Cystoscopy experience with bladder biopsy for Urinary Hesitancy,"Dear Community, I would like to share my experience and receive suggestions/recommendations from you to deal with suffering post cystoscopy or post bladder biopsy. I'm 37 years old and past 4 months I have been facing an issue with starting urine.   I found the world calls it as ""Urinary Hesitancy"". Although the first symptom was dull ache in lower abdomen when bladder was full. In about a month I had a delayed start to urination with no other symptoms. This only became severe. My PSA is in normal range, urine tests didn't detect blood, white blood cells or bacterial infection. When my doctor checked my prostate I didn't feel pain. Two Ultrasound reports didn't detect any abnormalities in kidney and bladder. 1st Ultrasound showed 70 ml retention and 2nd report showed 20 ml. So voiding was not bad. As my psa and prostate felt normal, it was likely not an issue with prostate. Thus in spite of everything showing normal , it wasn't normal for me . My issue is during start of urine, when I go to pee it sometimes takes time even 30 secs or more to start. On few ocassions it took 1 minute or even 2 minute to start urine.  On other times it comes out in 5 to 20 secs. First urine drops or a weak stream come out (after waiting for say 10-15 seconds) and then my urine starts normal with decent force and I'm able to control with sphincter. I notice when my bladder is 3/4 full I'm able to pee better . When my bladder is with less urine, it takes lot of time to start pee ( at times have taken 1 minute) As all reports were normal, I suspected the cause was uretheral stricture.  I was proved wrong after cystoscopy on 22 Feb. I chose the urologist who had more and good reviews and appeared to be well known in Sydney. (Still hoping my decision is right) I had a cystoscopy done on 22 Feb. I was asked to fast (except drinking water) 6 hours before the hospital admission and not to drink water 2 hours before admission. There were too many patients for the surgeon that day and due to delays from surgeon I ended up fasting for 11 hours before surgery. Anesthetist  kept me calm,  inserted an IV and asked me about my history with alergies and known reactions to GA.  He then asked me to enter Operation theatre and sleep on bed.  Then they injected  medicine to put me to sleep and on oxygen mask . When I woke up, I had high BP and they injected medicine to bring it down. It was very painful 1st day with bleeding urine and red blood clots on first four urine occasions. I almost had tears and was fighting for survival with every pee. Keeping legs wide and weight on both ball of foot hoping it burns less but it didn't. After several traumatic pees, burning has reduced considerably in day 2 but still feels like blades running through urine stream. Today is day 3 and I could still see urine sometimes is light brown (thinking it could be blood clot). I still have burning around penis tip and bottom urethera near tip especially when the urine stream is continuous, unsure if this is normal for Day 3. Internet search says one should get back to normal within 48 hours. I'm in Day 3 still not normal and not sure if bladder is healing. I also got mild pain in Day 2 in abdomen guessing due to bladder biopsy. Penis sometimes leaves brown drops on underwear, I think it could be blood cloth discharge. This happened on Day 1 and Day 2 . I only concluded in Day 2 its brown drop as I wore white underwear on day 2. I'm daily praying I get normal to life. My follow up with doctor is on 16 March to know the biopsy as well as cystoscopy findings. I will keep you all posted on the findings and my experience here in the community. My best wishes for your situation as well, I hope you find this useful and also we all get back to normal life. Kind regards, 0 likes, 1 reply "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/my-flexible-cystoscopy-experience-female--570669,My flexible cystoscopy experience (female),"Hi all. I just wanted to share the details of my scope test, which I had today, and hope to reassure others who may, like me, be terrified of having this done. I opted for sedation along with the instillagel, which is squirted into the urethra with a syringe(no needle). When I met with the anaesthetist beforehand I told him I just wanted to be unaware but not fuzzy headed for hours or days afterwards. They had me lined up for Midalozam which I had read negative reviews about and didn't want. He instead gave me Diazepam 2mg and fentonyl through an IV. I did feel the cannula going into my hand but it was no worse than a blood test really. One of the drugs could be felt travelling up my vein, I'm not sure which one. After that I felt them applying the cold gel but that is it. I have ""lost"" around 15 minutes. It's amazing as I was not asleep. I couldn't hear them talking except when they wanted me to move off table onto my bed again. I felt like I had had no sedation but got the good effects from it. All is well in my bladder by the way, that's a big relief. What I did find out is that I have duplex kidneys which means one kidney has one ureter and the other has two!!. It's something that is congenital but I never knew about it. Nor did my mother!! It can leave me prone to kidney infections but doesn't normally need treated. I was desperate to pee when I left the recovery room and was dreading it. It was fine the first few times but obviously the numbing gel then wore off and it was like peeing acid! Now, 7 hours later I am not stinging quite so much but I am going every 15 minutes or so, which I am told is normal. Anyone who has read my previous posts will know how terrified I was of having this procedure but I can honestly say that I would do it again if I had to but definitely with the Diazepam cocktail. I don't even have a  ! I even called into some shops with my friend when she was driving me home.

I did not know if this thing, what ever it was, came into either category. After explaining to the new young female doctor, who looked so young I thought she should still be in school, I felt about one inch tall.  She looked about 16. She asked me every question (almost) I didn't really want to answer. Can this get any worse I thought to myself, probably not, but I was wrong. Doctors and me have some history which perhaps informs my opinion of them and also perhaps my attitude, and that is that they always get it wrong.  That is tolerable if annoying, no-one is perfect. What I cannot cope with though is the embarrassment.  The fact that I'm embarrassed about the fact that I'm embarrassed, and the fact that they apparently could not care less how I feel. I need doctors with some human kindness, some empathy, same with nurses too. I have yet to find any. So long story short, two years later ( yes that is accurate, I told you how useless they are when it comes to me) they have decided they want me to have a cystoscopy. My problem is I am concerned about the emotional and psychological damage this will do to me.  I cannot think of anything more degrading and humiliating than getting raped up the penis. What makes everything much worse, is getting raped up the penis whilst disinterested uncaring medical people carry on as if nothing bad is happening in a vain attempt to normalise the abnormal, pretending that absolutely no-one is ever remotely embarrassed, humiliated or degraded by this procedure. Why do they do that? It is unforgivable and disrespectful. Why can't they show a shred of humanity? Would that kill them? I expressed my concerns to the nurse. There are worse things she claimed. Well not for me there isn't. So I am in a quandary; my logical mind is telling me you need to get to the bottom of this, and I know that I do, but with my problem is two fold, my emotional part knows how damaging this will be for me and I fear that my mental health will suffer significantly, it already is. But can I get to the bottom of this another way? And because they are so utterly useless and I have no faith or trust in them, I am concerned that I will be having to do this or something very similar many times, but worse many times unnecessarily because of how utterly useless they are, they seem completely unwilling to take my emotional distress into account at all. I don't want to be sleep walked in this test, then that test, then another test all of which are humiliating, embarrassing and degrading. I told the nurse if I do this, I only want to it once, she could not hold my gaze which didn't bode well. At every turn the more I ask the more trust disappears. Getting information from them seems to be on a if you don't ask us directly we won't tell you basis. I feel like I am dragging information out of unwilling participants. They don't feel embarrassed and basically think we have no right therefore to feel anything different. There seems to be a conspiracy of pretending no-one feels humiliated by this loss of privacy and dignity and they invite the patient to be a co-conspirator in this code of silence. I am refusing to facilitate this horse manure. Any ideas anyone? 0 likes, 2 replies "

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/had-cystoscopy-yesterday-782896,Had cystoscopy yesterday,"hi everyone, I had my cystoscopy yesterday after weeks worrying about getting it done. I tried to keep myself occupied to keep my mind off it but its always been there. and the night before I had it done I read a few forums here to get some reassurance. so I thought I'd add my experience so people are more prepared for theirs. the ones I read made it look like it would be easy, I got the impression that it doesn't hurt for women but does for men. anyway, I had mine to look for whats causing the microscopic blood in my urine that I've had for almost 2 years now, good news was that they didn't see anything abnormal, so atleast that's cleared up. so, my appointment was scheduled for 2.45pm, as soon as I got there I was given a urine sample pot to collect a specimen in, they took it away and tested it but I never heard what the result was. then I got placed in a room where a male nurse came in and had me fill in some forms to consent to having it done and also to put patient wristband on. he then said he was leaving and somebody else will be in after to tell me what was going to happen. as soon as he left another male came in, he was the urologist and he sat next to me and told me what was going to happen, I told him I was nervous as I'd never had anything like this done before and he told me not to worry and that getting a smear test done was actually worse. I thought to myself, how would you know?? he was really nice though bless him, but at first I didn't realise that he would be the one doing the test. for some reason I imagined a woman doing it. After hed asked me a few more questions about allergies etc, he said come with me and we'll see if they are ready for us. we went into another room and they were ready. inside this room was a bed and some equipment. there were also 2 female nurses in there who were both lovely too. one lady told me to take my coat off and leave it on the chair, and told me to strip off from the waist down and cover myself with a piece of paper. they didn't pull a curtain around me or anything and I felt so uncomfortable pulling my trousers and pants down infront of the 2 nurses and male doctor, but I just kept thinking they must do this dozens of times a day so they've seen it all before. I kept my trousers around my ankles and laid on the bed and draped this little piece of paper over my private area. then the doctor came over and told me to flop my legs like you would during a smear test. so I did that and the doctor said 'excuse me' and began feeling around my area and having a good look finding my uretha which I did find embarrassing because the nurses were looking too, but again they do this everyday and have seen it all before. then he got the syringe ready with what he said was lubricant and anesthetic and inserted it into my uretha and squirted it in, he said it would be cold and it might sting abit, which it definitely did do! it took a few seconds to get the stuff squirted in and as he was doing it I saw the nurse stood at the side with the scope in her hands and I must say it frightened me alot looking at it! it was alot wider than I was expecting, it looked like a black snake and was very thick! I wish she would of hid it from my sight because I tensed up immediately after seeing that. as he was squirting the lubricant in I said oh my god that looks massive and they all laughed and said its not that bad you'll be fine. Once he had done squirting the stinging solution in, he wasted no time in cramming the scope up me, it was long and black with a bright light on the end. ill be honest and say that did hurt me quite a bit having it shoved in, he pushed on it about 3 times till it was all the way into my bladder, they knew it was hurting as the nurse stood by my head kept telling me to breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth! once it was in i looked at the screen that was to my side and found it fascinating seeing the inside of my bladder there. it looked like what I'd imagine the inside of a scrotum to look like lol. very peach with little thin red veins all over. the doctor told the nurse to start filling with water and she said you might start feeling like you need a wee, but I never felt that urge, I thought they filled your bladder up to the top but they didn't mine. then he pulled the scope out and said 'that all looks normal!' I swear once the camera was in it only took about 30 to 40 seconds! he did tell me before it would only take about 40 seconds but I didn't believe him because my appointment letter said the appointment would last about an hour. it felt like even less time because the nurses were distracting me with questions whilst it was being done about my children so it all really did seem fast and I couldn't believe how quick it was! as soon as it was done they said i could get dressed and go home but advised me to empty my bladder before I left. I was only there for 20 minutes from arriving in clinic to leaving again. they did warn me that it might hurt to pee for a few days, and the first few times I did pee it did string and carried on stinging for a few minutes later, like a burning sting but not unbearable and by this morning it had gone and I can pee with no pain no. she said there might be some blood to but I've had none of that. so, I wouldn't rush to do it again and would only have it done if I really really had too, as I keep reliving the feeling of that scope being pushed up my uretha and it makes me want to squeeze my legs shut! but its worth it for the piece of mind that there's nothing growing in my bladder or anything. I seriously can not believe how fast it was, as the forums I've read on here say it takes about 5 minutes but mine was just over half a minute long. so if your reading this because your due to have one done, id say DO NOT look at the scope before its inserted, as I'm sure that's why it hurt me so much because I tensed up when I saw how thick it was, I was quite relaxed before that. and I'm pretty sure he didn't get the anesthetic time to work because he knew I'd seen the scope and didn't want to give me time to freak out, he could probably see on my face I was about to! the staff made it a better experience, everyone of them was nice and friendly and I couldn't fault them, they did there job and kept me as calm as I could be. so just be brave and grit your teeth as it doesn't last long at all and could save your life if they find something that shouldn't be there! 0 likes, 1 reply "

The infection eventually went away but the pain and uti symptoms have remained EVERY DAY for the past 365+ days. The symptoms are also getting worse- I am getting painful muscle spasms I cant control, abdominal cramps after urinating, and being in the water is basically asking for the worst pain imaginable. STI, yeast infection and all the other stuff has all been ruled out. And I always test negative for a uti. Its now to the point that I cant sit properlyor for long periods of time, or wear normal pants (which is difficult as a premed student). Crossing my legs like a lady is not even an option. My urologist tried to give me a cystoscopy but the emla cream he injected made my urethra feel like a fire pit of death. Instead of addressing my pain he asked if I took medication for anxiety (with which I am not diagnosed). I was dissapointed in him to say the least. No doctor that I have seen seems to know what to do and now my urologist seems to be convinced the pain is all in my head. Even on my calmest day I can have symptoms so bad that even tramadol wont take the edge off. My boyfriend sleeps on the couch at night when we are in school because I cry through the night because of the pain and he cant sleep as a result. My urologist seems to think my symptoms are a result of anxiety but I never had any emotional issues that I am having now until I had endured several months of intolerable pain and sleep deprivation. And despite being on summer vacation with less stress and anxiety inducing events, my symptoms are still worsening. My urologist pretty much refuses to see me until my rescheduled cystoscopy which wont be for atleast 5 months. What else can I do to get the help that I need?  0 likes, 5 replies "
Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/fosfomycin-for-uti-anyone-take-it--795595,Fosfomycin for UTI----anyone take it?,"I developed symptoms of a UTI which I decided to treat with   I had around the house (Amoxicillin). I took that for 4 days and symptoms went away but 2 days later the symptoms returned with a vengence- I then took some Augmention, but before I took the Augmentin I went to Urgent Care and gave a urine specimen. Much to my surprise I have a very aggressive organism,  which usually occurs in hospitalized patients, which I was not. The organism is enterobacter cloacae.  So now my urologist has prescribed this weird antibiotic, Fosfomycin. It is a powder you add water and drink it. It works directly in the bladder on the infection. Although my doctor says it is really a safe drug I look at some of the potential side effects and it concerns me. Has anybody taken this medication and if so did you experience any side effects? 0 likes, 0 replies "
Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/bleeding-795801,Bleeding,"Hi there, Please could you advise me on the following: I have been bleeding since October 2022 and December 2022, it became really heavy, I was given Cyclikapron, 3, 3 times per day, a course of 27 tablets in total; that did not work and i bled even more. I then saw the Gynae in January 2023, and the ultra sound revealed a cyst so we opted for the cystectomy and a D & C. Approximately 4 days post-op i started to bleed again, i went in for a check up and was given a Pulmnot, this really helped and stopped the bleeding; however, i had completed the course on Sunday the 22nd Janaury 2023. i started to bleed very heavy since yesterday morning, 24th January 2023; it has been a very painful period; I called my Gynae and i have an appointment with him tomorrow. I just need some kind of advice, as i am in such a dilemma here, i thought the surgery would fix the problem; however, i just dont seem to be healing. any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/female-cystoscopy-don-t-worry--226435,Female Cystoscopy ~ DON'T worry!!!!!,"I had a   yesterday afternoon. I've known for about a month that I would have to have one and I have been worried sick about it. Found some awful posts on the net about it, and then fortunately found many reassuring posts on this forum! Trust me that when the ladies on here say ""Don't worry""....DON'T! I've been so anxious, that I've lost sleep and my appetite over it. I was in and out of Theatre in 7 minutes!  I asked my husband to time it as I knew I wanted to do a review on here to help others, as it has been this forum that got me through it yesterday!  You are in the position for a smear test for the procedure. Knees bent and apart and feet flat and together on the couch. So no stirrups (which I was glad about, as I hate that restriction, and I had expected that!) First they swab the area down, then insert the local anaesthetic. That just feels slightly cold, but not uncomfortable or painful. Then the camera is inserted, and again, that didnt hurt either. The nurse holding my hand told me it was in and then let me watch on the monitor. Whilst the camera is in, the surgeon fills your bladder with water so that he can see it all clearly. Within a couple of minutes, it's all done! I honestly wouldn't even say it was uncomfortable. You are aware something is going on, but certainly no pain. And if the surgeon told me he was going to do another Cystoscopy on me, I wouldnt lose a moments sleep over it!  I was given a cup of tea after the procedure, and sat and rested for a while, and once I had passed urine the nurses discharged me from the ward. I've been passing urine normally and it hasn't even stung, so I guess Ive been lucky. I had no pain until a couple of hours after the procedure, when I guess my anaesthetic had worn off. It was just like Period Pain. I took a couple of Paracetamol and it eased off, and today I am fine.  So trust my post here! I am the biggest softy ever! And if I can do this you can too. Don't lose sleep over it, it's just not worth it! Ignore the horror stories you might come across on the net. It's easier and much less uncomfortable than a smear test! I am happy to help anyone I can over this procedure. If I've missed anything out and you have a question, just post on here and I will get back to you ASAP. Jackie  21 likes, 377 replies "

I don't want to bore you all with the details , but long story short , I was supposed to be having a flexible   , it turned out I had a rigid cystoscopy though with the consultant never mentioning this to me before the procedure. I suspected beforehand that even a flexible cystoscopy was unnecessary as I had no pain or symptoms other than microscopic traces of   (taken from a single urine sample ). I'm male, under 40.  Since having my rigid cystoscopy 6 months ago , my life has been turned upside down .  I suffered horrible pain for months in many different areas .  But the pain that troubles me most and still does today is the pain in my penis.  It feels like a constant burn in my urethra . My urine doesn't come out like it used to as well and instead comes out at different angles, sprays and just feels very different to how it used to. And finally , my penis itself appears to bend when flaccid and semi rigid (but not when erect, although erections are painful) .   This never used to happen  before this procedure . I'm literally losing sleep thinking there has been some damage done to me because of this needless procedure . Has anyone else had a similar experience after a rigid cystoscopy ?

Cystoscopy,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/cystoscopy-experience-way-better-than-expected-interstitial-cystitis-803198,Cystoscopy Experience - Way Better Than Expected! Interstitial Cystitis,"Hi everyone. TLDR: I was extremely nervous about my cystoscopy, but it was TOTALLY FINE and no way near as scary as I was building it up to be! Reading some of the reassuring stories on here really helped me. My experience was   better than I expected so I thought I would post about it in the hope of reassuring other people as well! It is a very strange kind of experience so it’s totally normal to be anxious, but believe me, I am such an anxious and sensitive person - If I can get through it, you definitely can!! Before: I was so, so anxious about this procedure, to the extent that I broke down in tears before I left for the hosptial. I can honestly say it was really not worth being so anxious about it! I think I was very nervous because I have suspected bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis, so I’ve experienced a lot of urethral pain and I was worried that the cystoscopy would provoke a massive flare up and just be very painful. Also, a few years ago I had a very bad experience with a colonoscopy which I was told would be “painless” … painless my a**!! That experience really effected me because of some very unempathetic nurses who treated me like I was being a baby and didn’t listen when I said I was in pain. So overall, when someone said I had to have an “-oscopy” and that it would be “painless” - I didn’t believe them! During: I can just say that my cystoscopy couldn’t have been further from my colonoscopy experience. If I have to have another cystoscopy I really wouldn’t be worried about it. I can genuinely say that procedure itself was, for me, PAINLESS. I genuinely couldn’t believe it. Someone on here said it wasn’t as bad as a smear test, and I agree completely. I don’t even find smear tests that bad but this was easier than that. I had mine done with the NHS in a London hospital. I think one of the nerve wracking things about it was, because of the way the NHS works, the cystoscopy took place in a hospital with doctors/staff that I had never met before. So I had no idea what to expect or if they would be nice. They were extremely nice and also clearly very experienced and calm about what they were doing. I did have a male urologist doing the procedure which I was okay with (they asked my permission first). I asked them if I could listen to music using one of my AirPods whilst they did the procedure (so I could still hear them with the other ear). They said that was totally fine and that I could even watch a video or use my phone if I wanted - thought that might be helpful for others, if you need a distraction, you can ask to be on your phone whilst it’s happening. I was glad I asked that because it made me feel more in control and like they were happy to prioritise my comfort. I also told them straight up that I was extremely nervous, and I think they were extra careful as a result so I’m very grateful for that. I was glad I had the music, but it was actually over so quickly that it didn’t matter much. I just find music really helps me keep calm in stressful situations. After I lay down on the couch they asked me to put my feet together and my legs apart. First they used a syringe to apply local anaesthetic. Very slight sting but basically couldn’t feel it. Then he put the scope in, but I genuinely didn’t even realise he had put it in!! I was quite shocked. I think I had the expectation that it would have to be sort of “pushed” in, like the urethra wouldn’t be wide enough so they would have to use force, but for me it wasn’t like that  , I didn’t feel pressure or any pushing. It just sort of slid in, to the extent I couldn’t really feel it. The next part where he looked at the bladder was very fast, I would say about 90 seconds. He twisted the scope a bit and I could feel it slightly - it felt like having a slight UTI to me, slightly stingy or uncomfortable. But genuinely it was 1/10 on the pain scale, I wasn’t in any pain. When he took it out he was very gentle and I could sort of feel it coming out but again, not painful. I was SO relieved and surprised. After: The uncomfortable bit was the bit after, as many people have said, and that was the only time where I felt a bit like “I can’t deal with it”. After the procedure they ask you to pee, I was expecting it would be very painful and there would be blood … there was no blood,  at all, so that was a relief, but after I peed I was in a lot of pain in my urethra area, a kind of intense burning or stinging pain, equivalent amount of pain to the worst UTI I’ve had (having had a lot of UTIs). I’m not saying that to scare anyone - you can get through it, especially if you’ve ever experienced a UTI l!! - but just because I wasn’t very well prepared for it! I was at the hospital alone and hadn’t taken any painkillers and there were a few minutes where I thought, I don’t know how I’m going to get home. Next 24hr: The pain actually passed much more quickly than I thought. I was in 6-7/10 pain for about 30 minutes and then paracetamol kicked in and it went down to 2-3/10 pain. When I got home and took ibuprofen as well, the pain was pretty much gone. By the next morning, I was peeing as normal with no pain. I was amazed! But if I did it again, a) I would have arranged transport home from the hospital beforehand, like someone to pick me up with a hot water bottle or an ice pack in the car and b) I would have taken a strong painkiller before the cystoscopy because I think that would have significantly reduced the pain afterwards. So that would be my advice! Coping with the after pain: If you have had UTIs before, then you will be well prepared to deal with it. But if you are having the procedure for another reason and you’ve never had a UTI, this is my advice for that type of pain: That’s just my experience and not meant to invalidate anyone who had a different experience. But just wanted to be reassuring to others who are anxious about this. You’ve got this! 0 likes, 0 replies "
