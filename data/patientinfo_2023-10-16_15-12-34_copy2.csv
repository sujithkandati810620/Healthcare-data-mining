The nail started with a few white striations in the lower 1/3 and has now progressed to turning a creamy colour. Dermatologist was unsure- thinks its not fungal as its coming from the nail bed up.

Recently it cracked and the left side of the nail became unattached. I cut this part of the nail off. Antiseptic wiped it and am now using fungus remover. However there seems to be a separate nail growing ( half my toe nail had been cut off ) , and it looks like it's growing into the nail bed. What should I do?

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/left-side-head-pressure-tender-spot-neck-issues-507738,"Left side head pressure, tender spot, neck issues","Hello, I am new here but I am a little concerned. I am a healthy 35yr old male however I have been dealing with left side head pressure for the last 5 weeks. I don't get a real bad headache but its mostly just pressure and its pretty much with me 24/7. I have noticed when I lay down or go to the gym with my headphones on it is not as bad but always there, I seem to feel it more when standing but again its always there even when sitting at my desk at work. I will list a few of my symptoms below in a moment but I did want to mention the last 2 years have been rough after going through a tough separation with my fiancée and only seeing my son a couple days a week instead of daily so my stress and anxiety was really bad for a while however I am dealing with that better now so I have a hard time believing this is stress related. I am a very anxious person and do not do well at the doctors, my blood pressure and heart rate go through the roof even just at a check up. The last few months I have not felt like myself, I have had a bad stomach my whole life but it got worse around November 2015 and I was having chest pains and tightness, long story short I saw my doctor multiple times and was diagnosed with GERD and I also had an EKG and Stress Test Echo on my heart which all came out fine thank god. Now a couple months later I was finally feeling a little better, chest issues and stomach still kind of there but no where near as bad and then randomly get hit with this head pressure one Sunday night after just laying on my couch. I went to the doctor after 2 weeks of the head pressure and he tried 2 weeks of muscle relaxers thinking it was my neck, my neck is super tight especially left side where the head pressure is and he told me to stop going to the chiropractor. I was going to the chiropractor for just a couple months before all this happened because my neck and left shoulder always hurt (I work out in the gym and think part of it is from that, I used to lift very heavy but I don't as much anymore). The funny thing is a week before this head pressure started my chiropractor did his usual neck crack on both sides and I remember it almost hurting, feeling different then normal and sent pain through my head. I honestly wonder if he did something to me and if this is from my neck however almost 6 weeks and still feel the same? Advil doesn't do much, muscle relaxers didn't work. I am doing neck stretches and just bought a hand held massager this past week for my neck and head. My doctor did not think brain tumor at my visit based of my symptoms and said my reflexes were good.  Sorry for the long post but hoping for some help, my doctor is now referring me to a neurologist but I am trying to hard to push it off a little more hoping it gets better, I have enough medical bills and I am trying to tell myself this has to be from my neck or something that will heal eventually. I know brain tumors are pretty rare but of course I am having anxiety over that. Symptoms: -left side head pressure 24/7. -some pressure in left eye and ear but not terrible. -neck issues, especially left side, recently got a massage and the massage therapist said my upper back and neck were extremely tight. Chiropractor although I haven't been in a few weeks doctors orders said my C-1 or 2 joint cant remember which one was out of place. I have been doing neck stretches and using a tennis ball. -some lightheadedness and fatigue, nothing crazy and could be stress since I think about this and worry all day. -just noticed this week I have a tender spot on the bone top left back side of head. -no weight loss, no fever, appetite ok for the most part, stomach ache some days but no vomiting.  I do get a little bit of facial tingles in the left side of my cheek and especially my chin, it is not constant and comes and goes. This did start a couple months before this and I went to the dentist because I still have 3 of my wisdom teeth. He did say they could come out and my bottom right one was coming in a little crooked and could be causing some pressure. He did I could hold off for a bit and it wasnt an emergency and that could be causing some of my chin numbness and tingles. Also I am constantly popping my ears because they feel a little blocked and my nose feels a little congested but this has been going on for a while and is not something new, maybe allergies Hopefully some suggestions and feedback will help, I will see neurologist if this doesn't improve but again I am trying to wait just a little longer on that. 7 likes, 265 replies "

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ive-been-feeling-very-weird-and-out-of-focus-for-the-past-2-weeks--794443,Ive been feeling very weird and out of focus for the past 2 weeks. ,"Hello everyone, a little backstory first because its a bit complex and there might be many reasons to as to why i feel like this but here it goes. About a month or so I was having some stomach acid issues so my doctor prescribed me medication. After taking it i had an allergic reaction to it and side effects which firstly cause me to feel completely restless and anxious. And then evolved into my tongue moving completely on its own. We went to the hospital and they gave me glucose through the IV which caused the side effects to ward off and i was feeling better. However after coming home the next day I was having massive anxiety and panic attacks thinking ""what if it happens again"" and sometimes i would have that restless feeling again. Not wanting to drink pills any more i decided to opt out for CBD to see if that would help my anxiety. However the CBD in the stores are expensive and the guy at the counter said he would instead give me some of his own CBD that he was growing but wasn't allowed to legally sell as it has slightly higher THC than allowed. Later that day I came home and wanted to try it. I had about 4 pulls of smoke when I immediately felt this sort of dizzy feeling almost as if i was constantly falling through the earth. I stopped after only 4 puffs. Thinking it was only temporary I went to sleep. However after that with each day passing it only felt like it was getting worse. The feeling i feel is impossible really to describe I usually say my head is spinning and i feel dizzy but thats not exactly the case. I can see everything normal visually but it feels like my brain is receiving 50% of information and im lost in space. Sometimes when i turn my head to look at something it takes me good 20 seconds of staring at it to finally see whats going on. It feels like im completely drunk at times. My head is spinning but without the spinning part. I went to get a blood test to see if there was anything and nothing came up. Im confused and scared that this might be permanent. Its been 2 weeks and no change. What the hell is going on with me? 0 likes, 0 replies "

I tried a tolerance break and I lasted a week before I had to cave because I couldn't even get out of my bed or adjust my position without sobbing in pain. So as for he facts of my surgery, it happened in either 2012 or 13, don't remember anymore. I have 30+ screws and two metal rods as well as five spinal fusionss keeping me held in place. It was an 80degree S-curve before surgery and ended 13 degrees after all was said and done. Th pain has gotten worse over the years and I'm wondering if maybe my hardware could be broken somewhere or what's going on.

My first one concerns whether urine should be maintained in the alkaline or acid range in order to assist in the prevention of UTIs. I find that bona fide medical information on the Net is contradictory on this subject.   What is your lived experience and knowledge and strategies this? I had a surgical   a number of years ago, then bladder uplift surgery.  I have long standing chronic  , and can also no longer push much, in order to protect the bladder surgery.  Due to the latter, for the past 12 years I have been taking Magnesium powder most nights.  It is an effective and also healthful treatment, but it alkalises my urine, which is observable in morning urine dipstick tests. In the past 2 years  I have experienced 2-3 UTIs, and significantly high and persistent leucocytes in my urine.   I believe this is probably due to low oestrogen and VA,  and is something I am also trying to find a work around and will address with another question. A urologist has advised that I stop the magnesium as he believes the alkalinity of my urine is facilitating these urinary problems.  I have tried the widest range of constipation treatment and strategies, and magnesium is the only safe and effective treatment I have found, for daily and long term use.  I am also not convinced the urologist is correct regarding the urine alkalinity issue.  WDYT regarding the latter? I have concluded that there is possible online confusion and conflation because perhaps the vagina needs to have an acid environment whilst the urinary system should be alkaline.

I just start. And i have no idea if this group is the right one. I am suffering from a very sensitive clitoris for years now. Over one hour or two the sensitivity increases and at the end it was like e little evil was under the hood and biting in it, if something comes in contact, even with the hood. It starts with a white coating under the hood and than the sensitivity increases, especially while sleeping. I woke up from the pain. I was at various clinics and doctors, licensed gynaecologist. They all told me, that i should be happy, most of their female patients have the opposite problem. The coating is not a disease, no yeast infection or similar. It is a kind of smegma. I am washing the pubic area regularly with water. Sometimes the vagina with a special shower gel. The white coating comes not regularly, 2 or 3 times a week. Not monthly, not depending on sexual activity. I tried a lot different underwear, cotton,silk. After the licensed doctors i tried the free ones, natural healer, herbal healer, therapists and so on. Some treatment concepts were very very strange, especially when the doctors were from India. The best results were injections with Botox in the sensitive tip. But it lasts only for some month and it was very expensive and painful. But one local pharmacist from India, he mixed me a cream, to make the tip and the surrounding area numb for a while. It looks strange but it helps. Now this pharmacist has gone. I think, he had no official employment permit. And with him my cream has gone. I have two cream jars left, but after it?  Now my question.

Sexual Health,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/genital-warts-advice-804713,Genital warts advice,"Hey everyone, First of all thank you for taking the time to read this. So from my last main partner. One of her lasting gifts I got from her was the genital warts virus (HPV). Kind of her wasn't it!! Well I think so. As just one time, nearly five years ago. I had some warts on my penis. Not any since then. The two women I've slept with since her were informed by me. They were still happy to sleep with me. I didn't know this ex had it. Whether she knew, I doubt it. She was troubled. Narcissist and an alcoholic. Before me slept around. I have been to a sexual health clinic in the past. Got an all clear, minus the warts! Anyway I've recently met someone so wonderful. I can see myself spending the rest of my life with her. She makes me so happy. She wants to take things slow. Absolutely fine by me. So we haven't slept together yet. Google is saying mixed things about the job virus. Some sources say you have it forever. Other sources don't. As I say, I've only had them physically on my wotsit. Just the one time. Obviously and morally I will tell this girl about this. When it's getting to that stage.  But does anyone have a positive way in which I can go about it? Do I still have the virus? Are there worthwhile testing kits out there for it?  I know it's quite a common thing. I'm very concerned and worried of loosing her once she knows. But as I said, it's only right to tell her. Hopefully she'll appreciate the honesty in telling her. She says she likes me the more she gets to know me. Has anyone got anything encouraging and comforting to say? Might be a good shout speaking to a professional? Thanks 0 likes, 0 replies "

I am scared of catching an STI through oral sex. Is that even possible now considering we did this 3 times during 12 months and we havent had any other partners (ever)? Following my own logic, I didnt get it from the first time, so how could I get it from this time. The only thing that worries is me that I have a small ""pimple"" in my mouth from eating extra hot food so I burned my skin a little. Does that increases my chances?

I have an issue that is causing me to have a lot of   and I’m hoping I’m not the only one who has experienced this and I just want this to be over. I have an appointment with a urologist in 10 days, but it feels like an eternity from now. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. I am a 34 year old male that In April felt a burning sensation when urinating that came out of nowhere. It felt like I was peeing razor blades. I had intercourse with my wife a few days prior so I just blew it off as a possible small cut or some irritation. As the days progressed, the pain was still there, but the pain wasn’t as intense. I then started to have the urge to urinate all the time even after relieving myself. I made an appointment with my doctor and I provided a urine sample. There was a high white blood cell count in the sample and he said I had an infection somewhere in my urinary tract. I took Cipro for a few days and didn’t have a good reaction. He switched me to Bactrim. I felt like things were better and I finished the course. After finishing the  , this sensation of “tingling” could be felt in what I can only describe in my urethra after urinating and not during. It’s not painful, just uncomfortable and annoying. I don’t experience any pain during ejaculation. Sometimes I can feel this on the tip of my penis. I went back to my doctor and he ordered a urinealysis this time and everything came back clear including being negative for both   and gonorreah. He came to the conclusion that I had urethritis and told me to take Motrin. That was a month ago and I’m still experiencing the urge to urinate often and this burning/tingling feeling in my penis. In addition, I seem to dribble after urinating and will often find a wet spot in my underwear.  Taking Motrin doesn’t really seem to be doing much. Is it possible that my urinary tract is still inflamed from the infection? Is there something wrong with my prostate? Overactive bladder? My health anxiety of course makes me think I have  .

Urinary Tract Infection,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/recurring-uti-since-may-2022-793224,Recurring UTI since May 2022,"Greetings, I've had a recurrring UTI since May 2022.  My initial symptoms were pain in my back flank area, and the urgency to urinate all the time. I immediately set up a televisit with the doctor who prescribed Bactrim, twice daily for 3 days. The symptoms subsided, but ultimately didn't leave.  I was able to manage through the pain by taking AZO pills, probiotics, cranberry and several other home remedies (garlic, ginger, etc.) until I decided enough was enough.  I went to the doctor in June to get some help... to understand what was going on with my body and the symptoms of constant need to urinate and my blood pressure was slightly raised.  I didn't feel right.  They did see that my blood pressure was raised, and my body was fighting something due to the slightly high red blood cell count.   They mentioned my body fighting something, but we had to find the culprit.  They gave me another set of antibiotics (nitrofurantoin) to fight off the symptoms and instructed me to take probiotics. That did NOTHING! Day 3 while on the prescription - I still had these urinary problems. This time it got so bad that my flank was sensitive to touch, strong urine smell, cloudy/darkish yellow urine and it was impossible for me to stand.  I rushed to the emergency room while on the prescription and they told me they couldn't do anything for me.  I should finish out the prescription and contact my primary as soon as possible.  I was LIVID because the prescription was not working. I left that emergency room and went to another hospital for help and they immediately helped.  They did an ultrasound, did a blood test and found that I did have a bacteria infection.  They prescribed antibiotics (augmentin) and asked me to follow up with my primary. Visit to the primary ultimately led to the urologist and then to the infectious disease doctor (2 month span all the while taking several brands of antibiotics):  I did a thorough an extensive urinalysis, MRI, and another ultrasound of the bladder and kidney.  which the results didn't come back for 3 days. Late August 2022, it resulted in me having a UTI, blood in my urine with E. Coli bacteria that was resistant to pretty much every antibiotic that I have taken.  The infectious disease doctor prescribed an IV Antibiotic (ertapenem) for 5 days that should have eliminated the bacteria.  It did!  The E. Coli was gone; HOWEVER, unbeknownst to me this new form of bacteria was growing. Fast forward.... late October 2022 to Present.  I called the infectious disease doctor and we ran another urinalysis.  The test results came back in 3 days.  I had another form of bacteria - Klebsiella pneumoniae that was susceptible to a lot of antibiotics.  My doctor prescribed Cipro 500, twice a day, for 5 days.  I finished the Cipro prescription a week ago, and here it is... I have the same symptoms that I started with.  Back pains, cloudy urine at times, and the urgency to constantly urinate. Note: I drink a bunch of water daily, I take probiotics, d-mannose, and kombucha DAILY. I am named the bacteria because I am just learning about them, and I don't know if I should STOP taking probiotics.  I don't like taking medications. I have been looking for similar stories, but I haven't found anything.  Does anybody have any remedy or advise that they can give to help this situation? 0 likes, 3 replies "

I think it was 1 week later (25.5?) I started getting the feeling where after I pee, I feel like there's a tiny bit left right at the entrance of my urethra but usually nothing more comes out and I do feel like I'm completely emptying my bladder every time. I assumed it was a UTI and stupidly waited 2 weeks. On the 8th this month I finally went to the nurse - the symptom wasnt worse or better but I was starting to panic about nerve damage from ads. She said I had a UTI (3 things showed up on the stick I forgot exactly what, plus high temperature) and was treated with an antibotic beginning with N? It was a 3 day course (took me 4 days because I started in the evening) but I was no better at all. I went back on 12.6 and got trimiphrim (sorry can't spell it) for 5 days. I was starting to feel somewhat better on the 2nd day and then I stupidly had protected sex (with my long term partner) on the 4th day.. it didn't last long though because I had burning pain (I'm not sure if that was related to the UTI though because it was my 2nd period day and I'm usually more sensitive as well as I don't think there was enough lube). The rest of the day and yesterday (last antibiotic) I feel even worse! I feel so stupid for having sex during a UTI! And now today I still have the same stuck feeling. That day I had sex I also strained to pee alot afterwards (to see if I could get the stuck feeling out) and since then the rest of my urethra feels itchy/aroused and a dull ache sometimes. I'm starting to wonder if it's even a UTI because surely after 2 courses I should be better now? Anyway my questions are: Do I need more of the same antibiotic since it was working until I stupidly had sex? Do I need a different antibiotic? If everything comes back clear (I'm seeing the doctor either tomorrow or Wednesday), what does it mean that I still have symptoms? Is it nerve damage? Other symptoms: Temperature ranging from 36.5c-38c Side ache Since attempting sex: Almost constant burning Discomfort under belly button Random itching/aroused feeling in rest of urethra (behind pubic bone) Better in mornings and worse throughout day Sorry this is long and if it doesn't make sense, my anxiety has taken over my life since withdrawing, my head is all over the place and my thoughts are coming at like 100mph but on the outside I'm such a zombie. My biggest fear that's taken over my life for 2 years now is the fear of PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder), Pundendal neuralgia, intistial cystitis and nerve damage.

Shoulder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/shoulder-surgery-vs-physical-therapy-790200,Shoulder surgery vs physical therapy ,"Hello everyone, I am very happy to have found this community as I am in the middle of a difficult decision and would love some feedback. I injured my left shoulder back in January 2022. In February, I got a cortisone shot which helped but the pain returned by around May/June so I started physical therapy in July. I am still in pain so recently got an MRI which showed the following: “Infraspinatus tendinosis with likely interstitial tear involving the proximal and mid fibers, with mild edema of the infraspinatus myotendinous junction” My ortho has recommended arthroscopic shoulder surgery to repair the shoulder. He says since it has been over 6 months and I have tried other methods ( , cortisone shot, PT), he feels surgery is the best option. I am in my 30s so he feels like I should recover well and benefit from many years of a healthy surgery. I have never had any type of surgery before (except   removal!) so have been feeling a bit anxious. I went for a 2nd opinion just for peace of mind. This new orthopedic surgeon said he would recommend one more cortisone shot and a couple more months of PT before the surgery in hopes it heals on its own. He said if it isn’t healed after that, then move ahead with surgery. I am not sure what direction to go in. Currently, I can lift my arm above my head although it is sore. It is painful when reaching to the side (ex: grabbing a drink from a table to the left of me) and also very painful when reaching behind (ex: putting on a jacket). It also feels as though my shoulder blade is swollen as when I’m sitting, it feels like there is almost a lump in my shoulder blade area. It is also difficult for me to sleep on my left side. Sometimes I accidentally wake myself up if I roll over. However, I can do normal activties although I probably couldn’t play golf or throw a frisbee with my left hand anytime soon 😃 Like I mentioned, I’ve never had surgery so am very nervous about both the procedure and recovery. I do not want to risk making my shoulder any worse. Making it worse is definitely my #1 fear in terms of surgery. I feel very fortunate that my shoulder isn’t bad enough where all doctors are suggesting surgery but I also am feeling very stressed making this decision. Of course if I could avoid surgery altogether that would be my preference but the thought of going through another cortisone shot and more PT just to possibly need surgery in a few months also isn’t ideal. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Any advice would be so appreciated 0 likes, 4 replies "

Although x-rays taken on the 8th February, 2023 showed that one of the fractures had not yet fully knit (""not fully united yet radiologically""), it was thought that the fracture was healing pretty well and showed ""satisfactory position of [the] fracture with some good evidence of bony healing"".    I have been doing exercises recommended by the physiotherapist regularly but am a bit despondent that, 14 weeks after the injury occurred (we are now in March 2023), I am still experiencing stiffness and aching in the arm and shoulder.   These symptoms are at their strongest first thing in the morning and during the evening. I believe that stiffness and aching in a fractured shoulder can take up to a year to subside and am wondering if anybody else out there has had experience of this and can share methods they have used to reduce the pain, other than taking NSAIDS.   Has anybody, for example, tried acupuncture once they have been reassured that the bones have fully knit?   I use products like Tiger Balm and Boswellia serata cream and also Voltarol gel when the aching becomes obtrusive.   Is there anything else I can do to help myself? 1 like, 2 replies "
Shoulder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/dislocated-shoulder-3-weeks-ago-weird-sensation-while-running--797886,"Dislocated shoulder 3 weeks ago, weird sensation while running? ","hi all! So I dislocated my right shoulder playing basketball Feb 24. It was fully dislocated, but put back into place by an athletic trainer probably about 10-15 seconds after it happened. No numbness or tingling, had full ROM after it was reduced and wasn't in any pain, likely due to the adrenaline since it certainly hurt afterwards. I played the rest of that game, then again on Sunday (conference championship game, and the last game of my career) with it heavily supported in a shoulder spica. The pain didn't last long and I have been progressing with ROM and strength through a rehab program put together by my athletic trainers. ROM isn't quite there yet, even 3 weeks later, and it is still weak and sometimes painful. There are only  two main regions that hurt, which are the front, subscap area, and a weird strip down the back that is like right underneath my tricep. But that all brings me to my question. I have been running recently (approved my by ATs) and today I noticed a weird sensation in my shoulder where it felt loose and almost like it was separating while I was running, during foot strike. I wouldn't call it painful at all, just uncomfortable and a little unsettling. The feeling improved when i was more aware of holding my shoulder up and more still (?) while running, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of what this could be, or if it is just the weakness of the muscles struggling to hold it in place with the impact? I'm also wondering if i need to schedule an appointment with my doctor or have some imaging done, just to make sure there isn't anything structurally wrong? hopefully someone has some kind of experience with this and may know what could be going on 😃 0 likes, 1 reply "

Any success stories with physical therapy resolving significant (in terms of pain) shoulder problems? Especially I would like to read how bad it was, and how good it got with physical therapy.

Shoulder Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/does-this-sound-like-frozen-shoulder--798404,does this sound like frozen shoulder?,"I first experienced   in 2018 - at that time it was just a pinching sensation. I was very careful about use of my shoulder, and it went away in a few months. I seemed to be in the clear. But more recently the pain came back, in a more severe form. After battling with shoulder pain for at least 6 months now which has gotten progressively worse and more painful I've received a diagnosis of  . I would like to get some feedback from others with this to know if this sounds right, because I was told there isn't much that can be done about it, except to wait a couple of years! Just to clarify, I never had an acute injury that would explain what's going on with my shoulder. The only thing I can figure is repetitive strain from computer use over the years. Also most of the pain I feel is not in my shoulder. When I feel pain it is usually in my biceps, or I also get electric/burning sensations going down my upper arm to my elbow, or sometimes also to my hand. It was about six months ago that I began to have shoulder pain - I only had pain while making a select number of movements: reaching behind back, trying to stretch my arms when waking up in the morning, putting on shirts/jackets, etc. So long as I didn't make these movements I was pain free. I was given exercises from a physical therapist which I did religiously every day but I never noticed any change.  However I was able to do the exercises without pain. At this time I was still able to reach my arm upward  and to the side without pain. Then about two months ago things took a definite turn for the worse. I started noticing that I could not make the same movements I made before without severe pain. I could no longer do the therapy exercises, or even more moderate versions of the exercises. Now things are really bad. I can't do any stretches or exercises at all without severe pain. There are only a very limited number of movements I can make with my arm which are pain free. I experience intense ""burning pain"" on the inside of my upper arm with most other movements.  Just about anything I do leads to pain in my arm: putting pressure on the arm itself, like pushing down on the juicer to juice an orange or pushing down on my right arm to get up from a reclining position leads to pain. If I shrug my shoulders I feel intense pain in the shoulder area. But most other movements cause pain in my upper and lower arm, like putting on clothing, reaching behind my back, crossing my arm over my chest. I can no longer stand with arms akimbo without intense pain in my upper right arm.  Even just sitting in an easy chair with arm rests, I need to keep my arms pointing forward for the least pain. If I bend my arms inward toward me at the elbow - intense pain shooting down from shoulder through inner upper arm. I feel like my arm is ""weak"" and my range of motion is getting more and more limited. I am also experiencing a constant throbbing/stabbing pain in my biceps area which sometimes lasts all day and night. It's often worst when I wake up and sometimes I wake up at night in terrible pain. I do not sleep on my shoulder, but on my back or the opposite side, but it seems no matter what sleeping position I adopt, I still feel pain in the bad shoulder. Does this sound like frozen shoulder to you? Also, if someone with similar symptoms found something that reduced pain for them or helped relieve the issue, I would love to hear about it! 1 like, 4 replies "

That very night and every night since, my brain has not been able to sleep on its own. It is as if it has lost the ability. I have no sleep disorders prior to this operation. For the 2 weeks following surgery I was so sleep deprived (sleeping only 2-3 hours a night and lying in bed for over 7 hours before falling asleep), that I started spasming and hypnic jerking whenever I would begin to doze off. I was then prescribed Clonazepam. It stopped the spasms. This medicine has been the only thing that has been able to allow my brain to turn off and allow me to fall asleep. However, issues still occur. I still wake up after 3-4 hours and when I wake up I am fully awake. Sometimes I am able to doze back asleep but still wake up every 1 or 2 hours. Sometimes, when I try to fall back asleep very strange symptoms occur. On these mornings, as I begin to doze off again, I may hypnic jerk/twitch some days or convulse on others. I may feel symptoms such as electrical firing in my brain that will cause my head to crank one way or my upper body to shortly convulse for like 1-2 seconds. One time I even felt my fingers gnarling themselves involuntarily. Another symptom is  . A final symptom is feeling conscious while my body is ready to sleep. I feel a butterfly feeling, as if I am trapped in my body and it will not allow me to go unconscious. This leads to one of two reactions. 1. I can move and ruin any chance of falling asleep. 2. I stay still and sometimes I may fall into fragmented sleep. Other times I may be trapped in a state of limbo. Hard to describe. I feel as though I am in a different position or doing different actions. Such as laying face down sprawled on the floor. In reality however, I am laying on my back still in bed. My neurologist thinks it is Restless Leg Syndrome but I have serious doubts. This seems way more complicated than that and I cannot find any answers. My only hope is to request a sleep study because I don't know what else to do. I do not wish to be dependent on the clonazepam but I cannot sleep on my own. Does anyone know what is happening?

The sensations I get feel like a surge/rush  of energy that is felt either in my chest or in my head - it jolts me awake, often followed by a sudden rapid heartbeat. Sometimes the sensations in my head are so intense, they make me feel like I'm dying - I can't seem to find anyone experiencing anything like this as I find it so difficult to explain - but it's like I wake up with this surge of energy that feels like a bubble growing and taking over my head and my whole being (often makes me think it's my brain being deprived of oxygen) and I jolt and have to breathe until this awful sensation is gone. It goes away pretty fast when I sit up but I get a bout of terrible tachycardia. This is the scariest thing I've ever felt because every time all I think is that this is the end - I have no oxygen any more. I thought it could be sleep apnea but it doesn't feel like I'm choking. It doesnt't happen every night, either.

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/rem-disturbances-rapid-heart-rate-662867,REM Disturbances - Rapid Heart Rate,"Hello I've been dealing with some serious sleep disturbances for about 8 months now. I can't stay asleep. I get ejected out of REM all the time and wake up with a racing heart. I have been to several doctors and they have no answers for me except that it's probably sleep apnea. I was tested and have mild apnea and have tried a CPAP, but I still wake up from REM all the time - even with the CPAP on. When I don't wear the CPAP, I'm never short of breath, I'm just pumped with adrenaline with a racing heart. I'm extremely sleep deprived. I have used Zopiclone and Seroquel off and on over the last 6 months. Zopiclone seems most effective but I know it's not a long term solution. The Seroquel helps too, but I'm a useless wreck the next day - I certainly don't feel rested at all - quite the opposite. I've been on Bisoprolol for over a year, but weened myself down from 10mg to 1.25 mg and finally, this week I discontinued it, hoping that maybe the culprit to all this has been the betablocker. When I first started the bisoprolol, it didn't affect my sleep at all - if anything, I slept well. The sleep issues started when I was on 2.5mg. I typically drink each night but have been doing so for years and have only experienced minor sleep disturbances from the alcohol. What I'm experiencing now is something else entirely.  has been proposed, but I've always had anxiety and while it often affected my daytime behaviour, it never affected my sleep. Once I went to sleep I was usually fine. So why all of a sudden is all this happening? I'm getting pretty desperate and would appreciate any suggestions or to hear anyone else's experiences with this. 0 likes, 8 replies "
Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/involuntary-foot-jerking-and-insomnia-802433,Involuntary foot jerking and insomnia ,"i have suffered from insomnia for over 30 years or since my early 20's and have been prescribed many different meds over the years most which didnt work.  I've been on Klonopin 1.25 mg to 1.5mg for over 10 years due to PTSD,   disorder and the severe insomnia. The Klonopin has helped with the insomnia considerably considering I've been on quiet a few different medications as I've  mentioned as well as counseling ect. About 3 months ago I developed a uncomfortable spasm type jerk twitching in my right foot, on occasions both feet but primarily my right foot below the ankle as I'm getting relaxed for sleep but I'm awake just in a very relaxed state, it feels like a muscle contraction sometimes jerky and they happen over and over each time i get relaxed. It can take 1-4 hours to fall asleep due to this, there are no other body parts involved. Saw my MD 2 months ago and he added .25mg of Requip thinking it was possibly PLMD or a form of RLS but it does nothing so I discontinued it as he requested. All my lab's including magnesium are in range. I've tapered my Lexapro to nothing thinking it might be the issue but it's not. I talked with my MD about the Klonopin possibility causing it but considering it's only isolated to just one foot he doesn't think so, we discussed a possible tolerance to the drug but he allowed me to try 2mg at bedtime but it made no difference. When I wake up to go to the bathroom and get back in bed it's gone or just lay in bed reading it's not there. I have noticed the more physical activity I do the worse it becomes and the longer it persists in bed. Ive tried Theraworks, thick socks, hot water soaks, slapping the foot and even lidocaine. I've developed a sleep anxiety over this. I'm currently trying to find a neurologist but everyone is booked up for 5-6 months.

This led me to hypnagogic hallucinations, so I just changed doctors because my new doctor can't seem to help me. this thing has sent me to the emergency room before I'm afraid to go to bed these days. I'm awake but it's not real I just woke up it's insane to me why I've had this all my life and yet no doctor can help me or anything the last one doesn't even know what it is he looked at me like I was crazy. so here is one of my most recent ones. My husband woke me up from sleep dragging a little dresser with two shelves into the room at least I thought it was my husband ""saying hey babe look what I found."" of course, I'm sitting up and i look down and millions of spiders are pouring out of this thing crawling up the bed towards me. my husband was flesh and blood real and so were the spiders. but with no real control my body bolted out of the room I mean it's like someone else is driving the car and I'm watching i have no control. so halfway threw the living room heading for the door I finally put the breaks on and stop my heart felt like it was coming out of my chest I stood there for a few minutes trying to figure out what just happened so when I finally make myself go back to the room I look around but no shelf no hubby standing at the foot of my bed instead he is asking me if I'm ok and if I had another nightmare. i walked over to him and touched him to make sure he was really there he knows I been to doctor after doctor with no answer i got mad and started searching the internet reading what I could so this is how i found hypnagogic hallucinations I have lived with this nightmare since i was a child and no known reason and no doctor seems to believe what I'm dealing with so i want to know for those who have this, is this similar to what you experience? how do you find a doctor who understands this am i looking in the wrong place?  do i need a sleep study type doctor? I've only been to a family doctor. I'm to afraid to sleep i have had 2 hours tonight before the waking nightmare woke me up again if anyone can pass some advice that would be amazing! 0 likes, 0 replies "

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/seeing-people-at-night-614707,Seeing People at night,"My first post! I was wondering if anyone else has had this happen, I know it is quite common but I can't find anything online that matches what I experience. I wake up at night (this has happened quite a few times now) and see someone standing over the bed, or in the doorway. I have read online about   and understand I am possibly still dreaming but what is different is, I can move. I know normally you can't, but I can, I turn my head away from the person and turn my head back to see them still there. I even grab my phone and shine my light, they go but when I turn my phone off and it is dark again they are there. I don't know if this is another type of sleep paralysis but it is freaky as hell! The worst was when I lived in another house, I had an office desk that at the end of the room. I woke and there was a skinny, creature, long teeth, mostly bone crouched on top of the desk. It was cocking its head and looking at me, almost like it wanted to jump off the desk towards me. Again I could move and even woke my partner up, but then when I looked back it was gone. Normally the people are that, just people, not monsters or demon like. The last one was last night, there was a man in army clothing, world war 1/2 type uniform, his face was clear and detailed, I didn't recognise him at all. But yeah, that's it, I am not really sure what I want to get out of this post, maybe more opinions or if anyone else has had the same, but I find it strange how I have all my motor functions and can move, looked away and back to see them still there. P.s I have noticed this has happened more since being on 25mg of Amitriptyline for headaches and blackouts. I had this happen before the headaches and blackouts and was put onto a daily dose of Amitriptyline. 3 likes, 34 replies "

I use a CPAP machine to keep the Sleep Apnea under control. I've had at least four Polysomnography studies over the years however because you are hooked up to various devices it is very difficult to sleep and hence provide valuable information. In fact I have found them a complete waste of time. I've been to see various experts over the years and the only apparent treatment for REM disorder is to be prescribed various drugs which only seem to make the issue worse and you wake up with a hangover every day. This makes functioning the next day problematic to say the least.  Some of the drugs I have tried to date include pregabalin, bupropion,  , zopiclone, mirtazapine, oxycodone...... I've had to move into the spare room because my wife became too scared by my regular attacks.  In fact she was too scared to go to sleep. Night terrors continue to plague my life which means restful sleep is very hard to come by and once awake I've come to the conclusion that why do I want to go back to sleep and have another nightmare. The nightmares are generally me having to fend off attacks from people unknown, where I kick and punch until I've hit something which brings the attacks to an end. I often scream, shout, swear and have occasionally fallen out of bed. Has anyone else experienced the above, know what the triggers are and how do they live with this? Thanks 0 likes, 0 replies "

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/unusual-exercise-induced-insomnia-622168,Unusual exercise-induced insomnia,"TL;DR: I have exercise-induced insomnia for which no one has been able to explain or provide a solution. I used to exercise regularly. I would wake up every weekday at 6am, bike to the gym, and exercise for about an hour before work. I would usually jog or do some other cardio for 20-30 minutes, then do weight training for the rest of the hour. I had help from a personal trainer, so I knew what I was doing. I felt great, and I was in the best shape of my life. I kept this up for about 3 years, before something strange happened: I would wake up around 2 or 3am, unable to fall back asleep. I was 33 at the time, and I know sleep patterns can begin to change around this age. At first, I noticed that I slept much deeper on days I didn't exercise (e.g. weekends). Then I began waking up in the middle of the night, but would usually go right back to sleep. It got worse. Eventually, I would wake about 4 hours after falling asleep with a feeling like an intense adrenaline rush or panic. It would last about an hour, and I would have poor, restless sleep the rest of the night. I did not have trouble falling asleep. I was in bed at 9:30pm every night, then would read a bit with lights out by 10pm. I would fall asleep within 10 minutes. When this started happening, I adjusted my routine. I worked out during lunch, or in the evening. No change. I tried doing more or less cardio vs weight training. No change. Today, if I exercise at any point during the day, I will only get four hours of good quality sleep. I've been to several doctors, sleep specialists, and neurologists. I've had multiple take home sleep studies, as well as one on-site at a medical institution. The only thing they've been able to confirm is that I do indeed wake after 4 hours if I have exercised, but no one can tell me why. Many doctors don't even believe my story -- they think it must be psychological stress that I insist on tying to a physical cause. I have found that walking, low-intensity biking, and hiking are all acceptable forms of exercise that do not trigger my insomnia. I can hike 10 miles and be fine. But if the hike is over very steep terrain, or if I were to jog for 10 minutes, then I have insomnia. So the intensity is definitely a factor. The sleep studies did reveal that I have very mild sleep apnea. My doctors have told me that normally it would not warrant treatment, but it could be related. However, the usual recommendation for such a mild form is simlply ""get more exercise"". My current pet theory is this: following a day of excerise, one's muscles will repair themselves during sleep, usually around 3 or 4 hours into the night. This process requires oxygen from the blood, so if my sleep apnea lowers my blood oxygen levels, then the repair process might cause it to dip below some threshold; my body panics, sending adrenaline through my body to wake me up to address whatever is happening. However, my sleep studies showed my blood oxygenation stayed over 90% the entire night. I'm currently trying out a CPAP treatment. I'm still adjusting to it, but so far it hasn't made any difference. There's no real reason to think that it will, but I'm willing to try anything at this point. When I tell this story, most doctors look at me like I have three heads, so I thought I would seek the collective wisdom of the Internet. Cheers! 12 likes, 349 replies "
Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/radio-static-plays-loudly-in-my-ears-when-going-to-sleep--804761,Radio static plays loudly in my ears when going to sleep...,"This is infrequent. It maybe happen 2-3 times over two months, but this is why I find it so shocking. It's horrific because it only occurs when I go to bed, and it's always just as I am relaxed and on the verge of sleep. It never happens at any other time. It doesn't even happen often, so when it does happen it really freaks me out. Basically imagine a out of tuned radio or an old TV with static on the screen, you know that buzzing sound that gives? Imagine that turned up to 100% volume, and the sound is inside your ears. It plays for just 1 second at full volume and only when you are on the verge of sleep. I don't know what that is or why it's happening, it's so infrequent I forget to mention it to my GP. I know I had ear grommets as a kid but I am in my late 30s now and this has been happening off and on for about 6 years. Naturally when it happens I tend to shoot up out of bed and have a panic attack, and then I have   for a few days around going to sleep. And then I am usually fine for several weeks. I was wondering if someone may have experienced similar or found a solution. I also have issues with seeing colours, little fine coloured dots all the time, and some larger objects and flashes of light. I notice the latter seems to happen around social situations, but the small fine moving dots are there all the time. They look like the moving static dots you would see on an old out of tune TV channel, but they are multi-coloured rather than black and white. 0 likes, 0 replies "

It's not  , it's just like I'm breathing really heavily through my nose. I don't have any problems with breathing loudly in the daytime - this only happens at night. I don't believe it is sleep apnoea as I'm in my 20s, not overweight, and I don't stop breathing throughout the night. I had a phone appointment with the doctor and to be honest he spoke to me as if he was baffled as to why I was even treating this as a medical issue and prescribed me beconaise steroid nose spray which I used for a month and it made no difference. Kind of at a loss for what to do at this point because it's really disturbing mine and my partner's sleep.

Sleep Problems,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/electric-energy-surge-to-brain-when-trying-to-fall-asleep--62180,Electric/Energy surge to brain when trying to fall asleep.,"Hi guys, I'm new to the site but glad I found somewhere to share my symptoms. I'm getting a sort of electrical shock when trying to fall asleep.  This electrical shock seems to be described on other sites as 'jumps' or 'zaps' or 'surges of energy'.  It happens not when I'm sleeping but the moment I am about to fall asleep.  Its like a sort of butterflies feeling in the stomach and then a rush/surge of energy to the brain which gives you a 'jump' and electrical feeling in the head and sometimes upper body.  The more extreme they are sometimes produce a twitch in maybe the arm or leg.  Its not painful but I guess is quite scary when it happens.  These can happen numerous times a night. Many friends/family I have spoken to say this is normal and they are familiar with the symptoms (I understand what they mean as it can be quite similar to when you suddenly wake from a bad dream) but mine seem to be a lot more often and extreme.  I know my symptoms don't seem to be normal.   I've been having these for about 5-6 weeks now (some nights are worse than others) but generally its been more or less every night.  This has turned into a vicious cycle because when you actually close your eyes at night to go to sleep you are actually waiting for the 'shock' to happen instead of trying to sleep.  Obviously the less sleep you have, the less functional you are the next day and so on and so on.  You then get sleep deprived which I believe also may trigger this. The only other thing I can add to my symptoms is sometimes during the day I get a spaced out/empty/dizzy/cloudy feeling in the head (hard to explain).  Sometimes this can turn into a sort of brain/head sensation where you feel you need to kind of 'shake it off'.  Again, its hard to explain, something like if you have restless feet and you need to kick out of it but its in the head so you need to give yourself a shake to snap out of it. I have read quite a bit about  /stress and these symptoms may fall into this category but the issue I have with this, is that I have nothing to be anxious/stressful about!  All is OK with job, money, house, relationship etc so I'm not sure how this all started.  Could I be anxious about this illness?  Again, a vicious cycle? About me - I'm a fit and healthy 35 year old guy.  I actually exercise quite a lot (go to gym/swim 4 times a week and have run numerous marathons over the past year). Although this fitness regime has stopped since I have started having these symptoms as I am feeling quite weak/tired due to not getting much sleep due to it.  I have no major prior illnesses and I am not on any medication.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking sleep medication. I have been to the hospital and spent the night where they performed numerous  /Heart ECG/X Rays/Urine and all came back OK.  The only issue I had was slightly high blood pressure (but not high enough to be put on any medication).  I have also been for an   and EEG epilepsy test.  I will find the results with these in about 5 weeks time. Anyway, that's my symptoms and hopefully someone might feel at ease that they are going through something similar.  Reading similar posts on the internet I don't think anyone has come to the conclusion on what in fact is causing these problems, even though a lot of the people actually been for tests and seen doctors.  Has anyone experienced these issues? Thanks guys, feel free to get in touch  26 likes, 676 replies "

I lost all of my life quality due to sleep, can you help","Hey, 23M, 72kg weight, around 175 height , I've been experiencing strange symptoms for about 3 years, and over this period, quality of my life has been progressively worsening. It all began with minor sleep issues. Initially, I'd sleep 8-9 hours but still feel the need to nap during the day due to excessive sleepiness. Currently, after three years, it has escalated to a point where I sleep up to 10 hours and still take short naps during the day, leaving me with no energy to function. Concerning sleep itself, I encounter strange hallucinations before falling asleep and during naps. I hear sounds, sometimes see things, as if I'm already asleep and dreaming even though I haven't fallen asleep yet. Additionally, about once every two weeks after waking up, I experience an olfactory hallucination – I smell an odor that doesn't exist. This happens after sleeping and lasts about 30 minutes to an hour (with the smell appearing for a few seconds intermittently during this time). I feel like I recognize the smell but can't name it, and it triggers a peculiar sensation in my body, often followed by slight twitching and intense coldness. Typically, when this smell occurs, my teeth and tongue ache the entire day (I also wear dental braces). Upon waking up, I frequently have vision problems, as if someone dropped a stone into water and made waves in it, blurring a point in my field of vision. The pulsating blurred spot in vision happens in the same spot in both eyes and subsides after a few seconds. I've observed that I remember a significant number of dreams (4-5 per night), and they are highly realistic and vivid. Occasionally, during a dream, I wake up to a loud ringing in one ear; it becomes 'quiet,' and I feel faint for a few seconds. All these symptoms, except for the ringing in the ear, occur only during sleep or immediately after waking up. As the quality of my sleep has significantly deteriorated, I lack the energy to function daily. I constantly feel the urge to sleep, and I'm starting to experience job and relationship losses. I have no idea which doctor to consult or what to investigate. The tests I've undergone so far include: MRI and CT of the head – clear. Vision tests – vision is clear, with no issues in the eye itself and its nerves (the doctor suggested that visual problems might be caused by something else in the body). Polysomnography – 5 AHI/hour, indicating very mild apnea. CPAP was tested but did not help. EEG for epilepsy – no abnormalities detected after a normal night's sleep. I would appreciate any assistance or guidance on where to go or what to investigate. Thank you in advance for any help. 0 likes, 0 replies "

This week I went passed day 6 and now I'm on day 7. I never used many sleep medications because you know the deal with that stuff you will just need more and more and more and it will eventually break your ability to sleep at all. I've used some zopiclon with some succes in the first months when I would be sleep deprived for about 3 days or so. After that stopped working I tried Temazepam and that did absolutely nothing for me. And for the record in total in this time I used 2 boxes of zopiclon and 1 strip of temazepam so it's not like i'm addicted or depended on them. The next step was after 4 days of sleep to take a valium and again that helped at first. But now it just doesn't do anything. Again in total I've not taken more than 10 valiums/diazepam in my life. On day 5 of no sleep I took another valium because well what else is left to do I HAVE TO GET SOME SLEEP. But to no avail. Then on day 6 well what can I do.. I took another valium in the hopes of getting some sleep. And I started listening to ASMR sounds. But nope ofc not I don't even feel tired when i'm in bed. I only feel tired during the whole day but when i'm in bed I'm wide awake. Now as I am typing this I am on day 7 and I got a lorazepam from a friend and I'm considering taking this strong medication because if this goes on for much longer I will literally die. I've also been referred for treatment in a sleep centers but ofc as our whole society is sleep deprived nowadays the waiting list is at least 10 months. And they don't care about urgency even though half the people coming their probably can't sleep because they eat too much crap (i.e sugar) And have terrible habits like taking the smartphones into their beds.  Things I've tried - Pills - Relaxation techniques - ASMR - Relaxing music - Breathing techniques - Trying to accept that I cannot change it - Weighted blanket (10kg) - M-line matras (spent 3000 euro on this s**t) it's a great bed but I still can't sleep - Reading before bedtime - Reset my circadian cycle with light therapy and melatonin - Bodyscan And I've tried many other things that I can't recall right now because as you can imagine the effects of sleep deprivation are f*****g intense excuse my swearing but I just can't take it anymore. And I'm seriously starting to get concerned about my health. And this is not a unique occasion as I mentioned on average I'm awake between 3-5 days a week not by any choice. All my doctor can really do is just prescribe me stronger medications but I would prefer to not use these. Though as I said tonight I might take a lorazepam to see if this can turn the lights off. What happens when I lie down in bed. First of all I'm tired when I go to bed and I really want to sleep. 20 minutes later I'm wide awake my jaws are clenched and its hard to unclench them. My body is pretty tense as well and my head feels like it's in a vice grip of madness (thoughts) Plus I experience this as a physical pressure by now. I sweat a lot, and now in The Netherlands it's becoming winter and I get the added bonus of sweating and then feeling cold and then sweating and feeling cold.  I tend to stay in bed even though I can't sleep so that at the very least my body gets some rest. For example if I go to bed at 24:00pm I would stay in bed till 10:00am or maybe even 12:00am because I'm just to godamn tired to get out of bed and I still have a secret hope the whole night long that somewhere I might be able to slip in a hour of sleep or even a few minutes but it never happens and I'm stuck in this cycle of waiting for sleep to happen. It's a pretty long story I know. Also  I just typed into google "" sleep forum "" as I'm so desperate that any new advice that anyone could give me I will try. Please please pleaaase I really need help. I am losing my mind. 0 likes, 19 replies "

For 4 years prior he had an increasing cough and trouble breathing which doctors diagnosed as pneumonia. They ran every test except MRI and sonogram and said he was fine. So for 4 years he dealt with it, thinking it was a result from having had pneumonia, until one day he couldn't walk. His leg was swollen and numb, and he was short of breath, so he admitted himself to the ER where they ran extensive tests including a sonogram and MRI. As a result they found multiple blood clots in his lungs and a huge clot in his leg. His blood work showed elevated levels of Factor VIII. The doctors put him on Xeralto and he's been on it ever since. Now he seems okay. He occasionally clears his throat, especially in the evenings, but he denies it and says it's just scratchy. His doctor is not concerned. My husband is 53. He's very fit, he surfs every day, and he is healthy. He's not a textbook case, which the doctors said is the reason it took so long to find the problem. My question is, why is his doctor refusing to do follow up testing? Not even one test since he was in the hospital in 2018. I keep asking for another MRI to make sure he doesn't have any more clotting, but the doctor says it isn't necessary, it isn't protocol. I asked for a referral to a specialist but the doctor said he spoke with them and they said there is nothing further they can do. I would appreciate any input, and thank you in advance for your help. 0 likes, 2 replies "

About 3 years ago i was taking a walk to get some new shoes and on the way there i noticed some shortness of breath didn't think much of it i thought it was just asthma has gotten worse. I didn't have health insurance at the time so i just brushed it off and asked my doctor to just give me an albuterol inhaler which actually made my breathing worse. Anyway i guess i didn't care about my health at the time and the symptoms weren't bad enough to go to the emergency department which i kinda regret know.  Anyway, the shortness of breath continued for a couple months i believe it was atleast 7 or 8 months. And then i had a very weird episode at work while breaking down the load i felt lots of pain in my chest i literally thought i was gonna die but the pain caused my breathing to go back to normal. And i can finally take a deep breath again. After that episode i had some mild chest pains that came and went for a couple more months but i was just happy my breathing was back to normal. I didn't seek medical care at all which i know i was stupid. But after doing some research online i think i might have had a pulmonary embolism and i did start taking fish oil and vitamin e since i heard they are natural blood thinners. Anyway, 3 years later here i am still alive not sure exactly how but my lungs aren't as good as they once were and my asthma has gotten  worse since that episode.  Do you think it was a pulmonary embolism? because i have high suspicions it was . Honestly, i have health insurance know and i think it might be time to ask for some scans to check for the damage as im pretty sure i have permanent damage as i still get chest pains sometimes especially colds flare it up not sure how.

The team started an IV of saline and took blood while I waited for an ultrasound of my lower legs. After 2 hours of waiting, I was sent for chest xrays: both lungs had a multitude of clots in the bottom 3rd. An anticoagulant was administered intravenously, and I was also given 2 blood and 2 iron transfusions for extreme anemia (my hemoglobin was 7.0, half of the optimal level for a female). By the time I had the ultrasound, there were no more clots, presumably because the anticoagulant broke them up. I was admitted and released after 3 days, with instructions to contact my primary care physician asap. My PCP prescribed Xarelto, Amlodipine and Hydrochlorathiazide, as well as Levothyroxin (my TSH was in the 12 range; normal levels are between 0.4 and 4.0), iron and stool softener, and gave me a referral for a hematologist. I explained to him that I had been taking 4-8 tablets of aspirin or ibuprofen daily for 18 years to treat   pain and inflammation, yet he still discussed the possibility of aspirin therapy in lieu of Xarelto???? Does that make sense to anyone? He also wanted me to have a lower GI procedure (which consists of being given an enema of barium and then being x-rayed. The test is embarrassing, invasive and flawed because it doesn't show nearly as much as a colonoscopy. I was 51 and should have had a colonoscopy by then anyway, and told him so. Since he still insisted I should have the lower GI done first, I never saw him again). Now to the present, I have had a colonoscopy and endoscopy and have no issues. I have a new primary care physician and she was perplexed as to why my previous PCP wasn't more concerned with knowing why I had so many blood clots. This brings me to my question: what are some possible causes of bilateral PE and DVT when I neither smoke nor am on estrogen, haven't flown in decades, and hadn't been hospitalized prior to 02/2018? I tested negative for Lupus and Sjogren's. I do have Psoraiatic Arthritis and OsteoArthritis, neither of which give a positive result on an ANA (antinuclear antibody for auto-immune disease) test, which I do have.

Pulmonary Embolism,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/exercise-after-pulmonary-embolism-804265,Exercise after pulmonary embolism,"Hi, I have always been a runner, albeit not a very good one. However I managed in the last two years to snap my ACL, which ive had reconstructed, and have two DVT/ pulmonary embolisms.   That slows you down!   My recent PE was in January, and the breathlessness after lasted much longer than the previous one, and is still there if i walk upstairs or uphill. However i have had pulmonary hypertension  ruled out on an  , phew, , so have recently started an exercise programme. I'm  jogging (careful on the knee still) for about half an hour a day. My running watch tells me that my training  level is good, but my fitness is decreasing! my VO2 max, it says, has also gone down  two points since i started exercising (its gone down 10 points since all this nonsense started two years ago) . This is a little depressing and I don't understand.  Has anyone any ideas? the breathlessness i find less of a problem jogging than walking as i'm breathing faster and shallow, not even trying to take deep breaths like i would walking. Its not what I was hoping for which is a return to fitness, gradual if need be 0 likes, 0 replies "
Sore Throat,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/slightly-inflamed-tonsils-and-bumps-on-the-back-of-throat-lasting-about-7-weeks-775219,Slightly inflamed tonsils and bumps on the back of throat lasting about 7 weeks,"I’m 23 years old. I initially got sick on Oct. 5th. It started with a terrible sore throat for the first day or two and then turned into a 101 degree fever, nasal congestion, chills, and body aches. I was pretty sick for about a week. I got tested for strep throat and Covid-19 twice throughout that week and they came back negative both times. Once I started feeling better, I noticed that I could feel something in the back of my throat when I swallow and my tonsils were still swollen. Using my phone light in the mirror I noticed a few bumps on the back of my throat as well (picture below). I have an appointment with an ENT but the soonest one I could get is still three weeks away. My primary care physician didn’t seem too worried about it, just said I should let her know if it gets any worse. They don't seem to have gotten worse but they aren't getting better. I got sick again Nov. 21 and have been sick since then. Similar symptoms to when I was sick a month before, with the exception of a more mild fever. I hadn't ever looked at my throat very close but I asked my doctor about the very pronounced red vessel in the back of my throat and she didn't seem think it was cause for concern. Is it possible that I have Mono? What would cause bumps like that to last this long? 0 likes, 1 reply "

Sore Throat,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/sore-throat-with-dysphagia-for-3-months-784443,Sore Throat with Dysphagia for 3 Months,"Hello. In February I started to notice some difficulty swallowing as well as some other worrying symptoms like weight loss. The difficulty swallowing is especially bad for dry foods like bread or chicken. Drinks are okay, saliva is very annoying though. I haven't choked yet but the best way I can describe it is that foods sticks sometimes and I need to swallow a few times to get it down. The area this is happening I guess would be around the Larynx/Hypopharanx area. In March I seen an ENT Consultant and I explained I was pretty worried about this so he did an Indirect Laryngoscopy and said everything appeared normal so he referred me for a Barium Swallow in April which again was reported as normal. At the start of May I had an Endoscopy (through the mouth) and again, everything was reported as normal with the exception of a Hiatal   and mild Oesophagitis. I have been prescribed PPIs (different to Omeprazole as I had already taken a 6 week course which did nothing) I guess they are suspecting LPR as I have had some acid erosion issues with my teeth in the past. Since then, the swallowing difficulties have remained about the same but I am also starting to develop a recurrent sore throat as well as what I can only describe as my ears feeling like they are blocked when I lay down at night, they return to normal when I get up and move around. Just going to be up front and honest, if this was something like Cancer would they have missed it between the Indirect Laryngoscopy, Endoscopy and Barium Swallow? Would appreciate any advice someone can give. 0 likes, 2 replies "

There is no swollen area from what I can tell.  So I'm wondering if this has anything to do with thyroid or lymph nodes? Maybe tonsils?

I have scoliosis and have done since I was a young kid, its never caused me too much trouble, but I do have a pretty deep Pectum Excavatus as a result, which goes off to the right, and I have a slumped shoulder and my upper pectoral muscle on that side is kind of, like, missing. I have always stood with all my weight on my left side as a result, and have always dealt with some pretty annoying back pains. anyway, fast forward to september. I had a panic attack based my uncertainty of a really nasty widespread infection that took ages for doctors to diagnose. The infection cleared up really nicely, but the panic attack left me with a kind of uncomfortable feeling in my right leg, that my doctor ascribed   to. now its november, and the uncomfortable feeling has spread all up my right leg, and my right arm, sometimes it is physical pain, sometimes it is just a tightness mostly at the joints, but more recently it has spread to my neck and my right rib, which feels very tense and heavy, but also extremely sore. it aches profusely, but is particularly uncomfortable when I'm laid down, and especially when I breathe in deep, breathing is also a slight issue, but my oxygen levels are fine. ive never really inspected my ribs before now, because my scoliosis was one of those things my parents spoke to the doctors about when I was young, I am now 23 and I heard that this is the age where the pains of scoliosis really start setting in, and I have noticed that my right rib (the sore one) protrudes out under my arm and down my side significantly more than the other. I was wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone and what I can do if so? could my panic attack maybe have caused a jolt which aggrovated something? just a slight addition: I know it may seem malicious, but I have had a CT scan of the brain, a full set of infection/nutritional/autoimmune blood testsand various reflex tests, and the doctors are certain its 'nothing serious' but the fact that it could be linked to my spine has only just dawned on me this weekend. 0 likes, 0 replies "

Scoliosis and Kyphosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/scoliosis-getting-worse-with-age-739830,Scoliosis getting worse with age,"I am an active 59-year old, normal weight, non-smoking woman, on HRT. I have had idiopathic scoliosis since very early childhood – you can see it on my early photos.  However, I never had any treatment for it as I was growing up, e.g., bracing.  It was not bad enough to need surgery. I have had a number of associated problems over the years, the worse being a recurring dislocating left patella, which I had surgery for when I was 25. Didn’t work, and the leg (left) is much weaker than the right one. Since  , I have noticed that my scoliosis (diagnosed when I was 36 as S-shaped and corkscrew), has got worse since menopause, when I was 52.  It is all the way through my spine, from the sacral and lumbar region, through thoracic, and into my neck, and I have facial asymmetry as well.  I also have an ‘oblique’ pelvis. I have lost height, I can no longer sleep on my left side, I now have to go downstairs one at a time, and worst of all – I have sacroiliac (SI)  , especially on my left side.  I feel like the left side of my thorax is lengthening at the side, whilst the right side is shortening (squashing up), with my pelvis ‘dropping’ more on the left and ‘hitching’ on the right compared to my younger years. I used to be an avid fitness fanatic (I was a step and Bodypump instructor for 20 years) and fast long-distance walker, with a long stride length.  But now, I struggle with a lot of exercises and I am also starting to find even urban walking on flat surfaces difficult. For the SI joint dysfunction and pain, I have had NHS physiotherapy, but this was just traditional SI joint dysfunction therapy including bridge work, and other exercises to strengthen my glutes.  It didn’t work.  Worst of all, the physiotherapist was adamant that scoliosis does not get worse with age – mine definitely has! Is there anything I can do to help the situation to ‘stretch out’ my scoliosis and redress my hip imbalance please? 0 likes, 0 replies "

In the December of 2014 i was diagnosed with Spontaneous Pneumothorax in my left lung and treated with chest tube drainage (ICD) ,then a pleuroscopy showed i had multiple large blebs in the apex of my lung, so they did a VATS assisted bullectomy followed by a pleurodesis , also while removing the blebs, they also removed a segment of the apex of my lung. Later on, in the year of 2016 , i had a spontaneous pneumothorax in my right lung for which ICD tube was put and i was discharged once my lungs expanded. A month after that my right lung again collapsed , so again an ICD tube was placed and then pleurodesis was done. After this i had never again had any episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax. But just a year back I had a check up because i had little breathlessness on exertion and my PEFR showed severe restriction.  X-ray was normal. Someone (i would like to rather not say who) said to me that it is because of the pleurodesis and there's nothing to worry. I still have breathlessness on exertion and on normally lying down my respiratory rate is 24cpm. Just yesterday while climbing up 3 floors i had rapid breathing. I read some articles on VAT surgery with talc pleurodesis... and there are studies which say that it causes only minimal long term adverse effects and short term effects like ARDS is rare. Now i do not know what to think of this report. So is it that I have severe restriction which is caused by Talc pleurodesis and that's tottally normal? Even if Talc is causing it, how is it doing so? By fibrosis? And if so...then can i say i have  ? and if that is so , my prognosis ain't so good then because it progresses , ain't it? Please correct me if am wrong. Thank you so much.  Please do let me know what this is. I won't be bewildered at all if it ain't good, am all chilled out. 0 likes, 2 replies "
Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/ppfe-revisited-706314,PPFE revisited,"I got diagnosed with  Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) following a lung biopsy about 18 months ago. Yes it is a rare condition and idiopathic. There is not a great deal of medical reports/research into this - I am the first they have seen in my State. There has been a slow decline and then a drop in my lung capacity, oxygen levels etc. No one has been able to give me a prognosis, and I am currently going through testing and assessment to determine if I am suitable to be placed on the ""list"" for a double lung transplant - which I discovered that PPFE can develop in transplanted lungs. Any idea of recent research/articles on PPFE would be most welcome. From what I have seen on the net, most are case studies. Thank you! 1 like, 0 replies "

Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/interstitial-lung-disease-pulmonary-fibrosis-new-diagnosis-advice-needed-695563,Interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis - new diagnosis advice needed,"Hello I'm in the UK and was admitted to hospital recently with a suspected gallbladder infection and was kept in on oxygen after scans and tests revealed low sats and lung disease! One consultant told me that blood tests had revealed a rare immune disorder which can also affect the muscles. At home now and on 40 mg Prednisolone per day till I see a consultant again re evaluation and introduction of a new drug - presumably something to suppress the immune system? I was asked how long I had been breathless or coughing and the answer was never! Ditto re muscle problems. Was just a bit tired when dog walking last summer. The consultant was positive and said they should be able to stop progression and maintain quality of life. Not holding my breath (or maybe I should). While in hospital I missed my gallbladder consultation at another hospital. This was to arrange surgery as we do know it needs to come out. The problem is I am now in constant pain . My chest hurts and I have pain below the breastbone. Plus I have had neuropathic 'burns' with 'pin pricking' and itchy, sore skin. I think some of it is due to the gallbladderand some down to chest/nerve inflammation but for the moment, the doctors can't get a handle on it and I'm on Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, codeine and paracetamol to cover all bases. So far only the burning has stopped. Has anyone had either neuropathic or ordinary pain along  with a lung condition? If so I'm hoping the steroids will help when they kick in - but it's difficult knowing what symptom is down to what condition.. I hate being on steroids and other drugs and I just wondered if anyone had found any particular drug/therapy/lifestyle/diet helpful (or not). Trying to be informed. Not helped though by the discharging consultant who refused to give me the name again of the immune condition saying that all I needed to know (patronising much?) was that I had fibrosis/interstitial lung disease. It wasn't in the GP letter either. All advice appreciated. Thanks. 0 likes, 5 replies "
Pulmonary Fibrosis,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/stopped-progression-of-chp-without-steroids--740324,Stopped Progression of CHP without steroids.,"It started with bit uncomforted in chest once started Gym in March 2017. GP/Specialist suspected heart issue but all heart test (ECG, Treadmill Test and CTCA Test) came normal. Health wise I had not a big issue but started feeling sleepy, exhausted and breathless while doing more exertion. Accidently in CTCA report, doctors found fibrosis of lung and referred to the chest clinic where done more testing X-Ray, CT scan, Broncho scopy and at last Lung  . After all that effort, it was not fully conclusive but the biopsy was suggestive of Chronic Hypersensitive Pneumonitis or might change to fibrosis in time. They did not find any apparent trigger or reason for CPH. We also did a mold check in house that came negative. Meantime, Lung function test (TLCO) declined to 58 in 6 months. After biopsy result, I went for a second opinion and both hospitals suggested starting steroid. Doctors were predicting 2.5 to 5 years and no remedy to cure or stop progress, only increase life span and better life quality. My mother had fibrosis and she died before 20 years for the same reason so I was aware of steroids side effect in lung disease. Before the starting of steroid, I tried to confirm with the doctors that steroids stops progression or just help symptomatically. I did not find a satisfactory answer and got information from many places that it can reduce symptoms but cannot stop progressing disease. Doctors told me that they would tapper steroid and convert to immunosuppressant after some time but those medicines have their own side effects. I decided to make research for alternative treatments, therapy or diets and started working in all possible areas. *) Mold *) Some weather impurities (There was no birds around me or my house) *) GRED that might up flow and effect the lungs *) Some Parasites or Some unknown reasons **To Target all-possible reasons simultaneously I started all trials together because I was in lack of time. ** *) Serrapeptase –– Twice a day Empty Stomach (Very Important)  as anti-scarring for reducing scars in lung. *) Bromelain -– Twice a day Empty Stomach (Very Important)  as anti-inflammatory for reducing inflammation in the Lungs *) Vitamin D – That is very important for recovery in this kind of disease. *) Probiotic is for gut settlement and reducing GRED *) Installed of high quality air purifier and tried to use it maximum possible (at least all night) *) Spinach juice twice a week as anti-oxidant *) Pranayam - Breathing excise for 15 minute a day *) Made my sleeping bed a bit sloppy, High at head side then leg side to reduce acid reflux coming upward. *) Food grade Hydrogen Peroxide spray inhalation 5 puffs twice a day for 6 month – Now taking some times only *) In addition, I started regular walk of 20 minute and one-day gym due to pre-diabetic condition to reduce sugar level in blood. Now I am not pre-diabetic. Below are the things I started but stopped due to side effects *) CBD - done reaction, raised my blood pressure so stopped. *) L-Glutamine - become heavy on stomach so stopped I was monitoring situation, first LFT every 3 month then every 6 month. As the UK has no policy to do CT scan, I got it done from other country every year to check the situation. After all this started, with in 6 month the Lung function test (TLCO) started improving from 58 and coming back to normal and reached 74. Now all feelings of illness, sleepiness and breathlessness gone. Breathing is improved. We have LFT every 6 months now to monitor. Doctors want to close my case (Which I do not want because I want to monitor situation continuously). For the last one and half Years, I am perfectly fine, not any feeling of illness or uncomforting.

Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/constant-head-pressure-792159,Constant Head Pressure,"Hi Everyone, I have been suffering from constant head pressure for years. I have seen neurologists and musculoskeletal specialists. I have had MRI scans of my neck and head, but still they cannot help me. My head pressure causes fatigue, brain fog, muscle stiffness. I can see my floaters in my eye more drastically than I could before. The head pressure is also made worse by certain smells. Bleach, Smoke, Vapes, Floor Cleaners make the pressure unbearable, and really makes me ill, and takes a long time (weeks) to go off. When I say 'go off' I mean it goes back to a base level.  When it is really bad I get muscle twitches/spasms all over my body, and when this happens the pressure goes off in my head a little bit with each spasm. My neck will also move and crunch. It almost feels as if the inside of my head or my brain is moving and crunching.  When these crunches happen it definitely helps alleviate the head pressure. I have had my neck examined and they can't see any pinched nerves or severe degeneration that would cause this. however, there is a bone spur in my neck. I routinely see  an osteopath and have also seen chiropractors, which helps a little. If anyone has any experience of these symptoms or had any success with any medication that helps with these similar issues, then please post below or contact me. I would be very grateful for any help you could offer. 0 likes, 1 reply "

My husband has had these sympotms for a few months now. He has seen 2 Doctors and had CT w and w/o / MRI of brain W and W/O blood work and MRI of neck and spine and also MRA and MRV. He is not over weight and extremely active his whole life. When he sneezes it feels like a sharp piercing pain in his frontal forehead from temple to temple. He gets this with any straining and also when he tries to move around in bed such as turning from side to side. He cannot pick things up off the ground nor tie his shoes. The same pain if he tries to get in the car too. He rates this sharp apin a 9-10 everytime. Nothing takes this pain away. He can no longer do sit ups or push ups the closer the head is to the ground the instesity of the pressure pain is there. Once this has happens its a lingeirng   for hours until he takes ibupropen. This has become dibiltating to his life. These simple tasks create pain for him daily. He doesnt smoke nor does he take any socail drugsor ever has he eats healthy and takes care of himself. He did take doxycycline in September for chest cold before the symptoms began in October. They have progressed since then. The ER doctor suggested teeth grinding..so were going to a doctor..but I thought it to be comical honestly. All the testing he has had done if read correctly by the radiologist are all in the clear no tumor no blockage no  . So now its possibly idiopathic intrcranial pressure he has maybe and there giving him acetazolamide..to see if it works to relive symptoms..but he has not pressure behind the eyes and no vision problems.He doesnt even have headaches unless he does those few movemets. He doesnt seem to meet the criterai of the IIH diagnosis I saw on the side effects of the doxycycline it can associated with the increased cranial pressure..I just hope someone else who has the same awful symptoms and is suffering will read this and provide some insight its so scary because after all this all these tests we no nothing........more doctors on the horizon more tests too..this is no way for somone to live without help in our modern life of science...the doctors to I feel are flooded with patience and its hard to find a doctor who will really listen and understand. 0 likes, 6 replies "
Headache,https://patient.info/forums/discuss/head-pressure-brain-fog-odd-head-sensation-feeling-detached-414182,"Head pressure, Brain fog, odd head sensation, feeling detached","Hi all,  I decided to become a member and make a post here after reading the forums for quite a while, great site by the way.  I am currently suffering with various symptoms and am in a bad way and just don't know where to turn any more so thought I would post here and see if anyone has any similar experiences or advice.  So first of I am male and 26 years old. I have been suffering with the symptoms in the title pretty consistently for about 2 and a half years now. I used to have some relief from the symptoms for a day or 2 here and there or maybe a bit of relief for a few hours in the day but recently the symptoms are pretty much constant and I cannot shake them.  I have an overall mild pressure feeling in the head, its not painful but is just very aggravating and feels really strange. I also have extreme brain fog with this and like a fuzzy head, there is a constant cloud over my brain and I never have any mental clarity or a clear head. My cognitive function is extremely poor now, my short term memory is non existent, its scarily bad. I often feel, detached from reality when the symptoms are bad and suffer from de-realisation, although I think this may be down to some anxiety and depression I experience when the symptoms run me down. I also get random sharp cramping pains in the head, they are quite painful but do not bother me so much as they only usually last a second or 2, it varies on how many I get of these each day but its usually less than 5. It often feels as though my brain is malfunctioning somehow and my cognitive function and senses are all out of whack, its hard to explain. There can sometimes be a build up of these symptoms throughout the day and by the night I can feel like I somehow how the flu without a fever? Like I have the head pressure, completely foggy headed, I feel super unwell, weak, sometimes even start feeling cold. Also have night sweats usually for about 4 or 5 days each month, there doesnt seem to be any sort of pattern to them that I can notice, so not sure if they are relevant. Another thing I have is ringing in ears which is mild but seems to have gotten worse recently if that sounds relevant at all. The main thing that gets me is the odd head pressure/sensation and the utterly life hindering brain fog, my brain feels like it is coated in a dark blanket constantly. I do suffer from anxiety, I know many of these symptoms can be caused or made worse by these symptoms. I dont doubt that anxiety is a contributing factor and the way I think about they symptoms probably makes them worse but I have come a long long way with my anxiety, I have good control over it, I haven't had a panic attack in a couple of years, I manage to control most of my concious anxiety and stay in a positive mindset. No doubt I still have some subconscious anxiety underlying and I am working on that but I am not convinced this is the route cause of my symptoms. I am in therapy for my anxiety. I do not feel I will ever fully recover while I have these symptoms hanging over me though.  I have been to the doctor about these symptoms, although I do think I struggle to explain them or put them across very well in the doctors office. I have have blood tests which are all normal. I saw a neurologist couple of years back when this started, had a CT scan which was normal, they put the stabbing pains down to icepick headaches and thought the other symptoms were probably made worse by my anx/depression. Since then I went away and have been on anti depressants etc with no improvement of symptoms. I have also had a few ECGs and a 24hr ECG as I have slow heart rate and low bp so thought maybe the symptoms could be down to low bp and lack of blood to the brain, doctors do not think think this is the case and all my results came back normal. I have recently been back to the neurologist who is referring me for an MRI although he said he is sure there is nothing sinister and thinks the symptoms are probably tension type headaches and made worse by and previous drug use, he only put it down to the drug use when i told him about it though so it seemed like a convenient diagnosis. I forgot to mention I used to take drugs on the weekends socially, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy on different occasions for a couple of years, I have had periods where I have felt ok since taking these drugs and do not really think they are the cause, I was not an addict this was just one or 2 nights a month at the weekends. So I have an MRI coming up but the neuro thinks it will be clear and obviously I hope it is and I am looking for other answers.  What could be causing these symptoms? Other than anxiety which i no can be a factor, but I have periods where my anxiety is pretty much non existent but these symptoms still build up out of nowhere and persist. I was thinking maybe some sort of allergy could be a possibility, I have tried cutting out gluten and lactose, this didn't seem to make much difference although I didn't stick to this for very long. I actually did a juice fast for 2 weeks with eating nothing other than fruit and veg juice put through a juicer to see if that would help but it didn't really give me any relief. Are there any other stomach issues that could cause this? I never have diarrhoea or constipation, my stools always float recently though, to the point of not being able to flush them, also whenever I have seen chance medicine doctors they check me out and say they think i have issues with digestion, i don't feel i have these issues but do wonder if there might be something in it.  Could there be something going on with the blood vessels in my head? Could it be a spine/posture issue? Some sort of epilepsy or electrical activity in my brain? I just have no idea now and am desperate for some relief. If anyone has any ideas or advice I would really appreciate it.  Oh just to add I am reasonably fit, I try go to the gym a few times a week and I do some weight lifting. I am a normal weight. I have been losing some weight recently which is a concern but I am still in a normal weight range for height and age.  Thanks for reading 55 likes, 1493 replies "

It does not reach to the skin beneath, but it is very thin, I worry about it cracking and forming a sharp point. Like mentioned, this is the same toe I have had an ingrown nail on as well, but that was about 6 years ago and only lasted about a year at most. : With this groove issue, I feel no pain, no redness, nothing really, it's just gross and annoying. At the very base of the nail once pulling back the cuticle slightly it seems like there is a slightly darker discoloration beneath the nail directly under the groove. Cannot confirm very well as the groove tends to obscure things somewhat. : The closest thing I have found that may relate to this is 'Longitudinal Melanonychia' but cannot get confirmation on that-- the doctor turned me away saying this doesn't affect my health 😠 But I have scheduled to see another. I assume some sort of fungal issue. : I have attempted many things and natural remedies, as I want to avoid any and all surgery, and cannot gain access to any prescriptions to topical fungal applications (if it is a fungal issue) I've tried warm Epsom saltwater soaks (multiple times per week for maybe a month or two, I don't keep very good track) Hydrogen peroxide soaks (every day for about a month- this is believed to have helped the ingrown toe years back) Charcoal/tea tree oil applications (somewhat regular for several months) Even blue/red light therapy (each day for about a month) As you can see, I do not hold these attempts as long as I should as they are very tedious, I have seen so little change that I become demotivated, and don't want to waste my time just to find out it doesn't work. If there are any suggestions for OTC topical applications or other remedies, or any idea as to what the name of this condition is or what may cause something like this in the first place,  PLEASE let me know!!
