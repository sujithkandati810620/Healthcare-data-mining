Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Constant-Sickness/show/3076575,Constant Sickness,"Has anyone constantly been getting sick since having covid? Ever since I had it in July of last year, maybe a month or so afterward, I have been getting sick nonstop from stomach bugs, strep, and the main kicker which is cold/allergy like symptoms with sore throat, sinus, mucus, and sometimes coughing, etc... anything and everything! Not even exaggerating, I get sick every other week and at the most two weeks if I am very lucky. I feel good for a week at a time and it's usually when I'm on antibiotics. I have taken antiboitcs 4 times this year (it's only the beginning of May) for the cold/allergy symptoms because it always seems to return then turn into a sinus infection or just a horrid sickness that I can't get rid of without treatment. Over the counter medication seems to do absolutely nothing for me.. dayquil, nyquil, claritin, zyrtec, flonase, you name it... no relief. I've tried taking womens vitamins, all kinds of immune vitamins... nothing seems to improve or help. I even ended up getting c diff and landed in the hospital for about a week due to taking so many antibiotics... last course they put me on for 3 weeks... I am so afraid to get sick again... but I already feel it coming on now that I'm toward the end of the c diff issue.. sore throat started coming on yesterday and now I have that overall sick feeling coming on today with slight stuffy nose and mucus this morning. Please HELP!!!!!! I am so depressed. I cannot keep doing this, as it is taking my entire life from me. All I have time to do now is work then alternate between being sick and then spending the time I am well cleaning and catching up on housework I couldn't do while sick then cycle repeat. All I want is to be able to take my kids places and do something fun for once.. Doctors are no help. I have an allergy test scheduled, but I keep having to reschedule due to illness. I also just ordered a genetics kit to see if that turns up any kind of beneficial results. I am so desperate. Someone please help me... :("

We've had two bouts of the sick in the past three months that hit our whole house. The first was in July and brought to us from my darling husband who had traveled in Europe for work. I personally was the sickest of all. Fever, super sore throat, nausea, headache, congestion. Not gonna lie, it was brutal. We didn't think we had covid but I do kind of wonder after the fact. NOW, we are all sick again. I'm starting to feel a bit better but it's sore throat, cough, congestion and fatigue. The last illness was sick level 9 out of 10 for me and this is like level 4. Our home tests always say negative. Not confident in them and to test for covid here now is an ordeal. Last time my husband did get tested at an urgent care and was negative but not confident about that either. Anyway, I'm just curious as to what people are seeing or is my family the only one plagued by illness lately?"

Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Post-Covid-Constipation/show/3076797,Post Covid Constipation?,"For the past month after a bout with Covid/Flu, my bowel movements consist of passing stools that come out in pieces. For years intermittently I might experience this on occasion, but this would go away in a matter of days on its own, or with some additional fiber into the diet. I noticed that immediately after Covid subsided I was constipated and didn't go for a few days -- then I started getting regular again, except this persistent breakage. At times it feels like it breaks as it passes (looks rather normal other than coming out in pieces); other times it just comes out in pieces with the pebble look. Haven't gone the laxative route yet but have tried some apple pectin with mixed results so far; one night I drank smooth move tea but that didn't do anything. Any thoughts on having these types of symptoms post covid? Figure this sounds like a bout of persistent constipation but the duration (a month now) is longer than I have experienced before. Any thoughts or similar experiences?"

So, I got something to try and wanted to know if anyone else has heard of this.  I listened to a radio program about it and it is retraining your smell. I purchased a smell training kit online.  Pretty cheap. But it has four scents and I'm supposed to expose myself to them for a few seconds twice a day. What exactly this will do, I have no idea.  ha.  I'm charting it.Lemon is very faint.  Rose is strange.

(Unvaxed older female),"I was not vaccinated and got hit hard by Covid. I am a 60 year old female. After nearly 3 years of super cautious behavior, I wonder if the new very contagious strain is what got me. At lunch I was fine and by dinner I had the worst headache of my life, couldn't eat, and temp reached 102 at 1 am, the next day going up to 102.7 Tested positive on rapid covid antigen test  I also felt like i had knife blades in my throat and my nose and throat were quite congested. I was nauseous and could not eat for a whole week. Urine output was minimal although i was drinking a fair amount of water. Temp fell and then rose again but not to as high a level. Remained feeling very ill and congested Noticed throughout my heart rate was elevated but i attributer that both to fever and dehydration. After a week i started eating but remained very congested. My pulse ox meter did not show any dip in oxygen saturation at fingertip. I was encouraged to go to ER for fluids but I did not go despite being close. I felt very sick. Its now been two and a half weeks since covid onset and I've noticed something odd about my heart. First i saw on pulse oximeter that not only had it remained higher than usual, but it would speed up then slow down then speed up then slow down. It was not a stable rhythm. I used my kardia monitor  and also payed for membership to get the advanced feature of a graph of the R-R interval. It was highly variable and Was able to determine that this was a a sinus arrhythmia. So not a fib or flutter but varying rhythm . Docs have been frustrating on this. If you look this up, you'll find  it is fine if you are a kid but if you are older and get it as an adult, it usually signifies heart disease  i do not know if mine is respiratory or non- respiratory sinus arrhythmia but either way  in older adult indicates an underlying problem. Very frustrating to have a doc instead say “normal variant” despite this and despite never having it before. Before covid i had Sjogrens Syndrome, dysautonomia, and a mast cell issue , so not in the best of health and knew i would get hit hard Currently , besides heart (also 25 beats higher than normal) , temp still a degree higher than usual, lots of sinus pressure, anosmia, intense rib pain apparently  from a few coughing fits, Headaches, sleeping alot, eating alot, and i Don't feel back to my usual self yet. I assume too soon for long covid Anyone else experience a heart change? And  still there 2.5 weeks past onset? It might be easy to miss this one if one weren't obsessively checking pulse ox meter. and noticed the odd jumping around was different than usual. Any  comments? Input would be helpful. Will i feel better? What about the body temp and headaches? Etc. Thanks for any help. I don't have enough stories to know  how typical or atypical my case was, especially from unvaccinated older people   Would be helpful to compare. Thanks"

(Apologies if the post is long!),"Hey all, so I’m based in India where over the past month or so, there has been an uptick in infections which is pointing to a new wave that’s underway. I managed to not catch COVID in first three waves (or maybe I didn’t show any symptoms, I dunno), but tested positive on June 13th. I went through 2-3 days of 101 F fever, general tiredness, but was fine shortly afterwards. There was a lingering scratchyness in the throat, coupled with a stuffy (not runny) nose for a few days, but that also is largely gone. I took a test today that showed I’m negative now. I checked my weight today and realised I had dropped a fairly significant amount this month. Going through my phone’s health app, I realised that I was at 118.4 kgs / 261 lbs on June 3rd which has now come down to 113 kgs / 249 lbs. Barring a few days, I have generally been eating a very low calorie and clean diet. Plus the last couple of days, have been eating slightly less since my stomach was upset. My questions: - Have folks with COVID experienced similar weight loss in a short time? - Is a 5.4 kg / 12 lbs drop over a 25 day period that overlapped with a 12 day COVID period normal for an (overweight) guy like me? Thanks in advance for your responses!"

Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Why-shortness-of-breath/show/3069177,Why shortness of breath?,"I am at the moment Covid-19 pos so I chose to post here however I don’t need to have covid for this to occur but for it to get as bad as I will talk about here I need to have a respiratory infection of some kind. I also have Sjögren’s syndrome which has me taking a steroid inhaler twice a day so I can breathe in the cold winter air. No asthma apparently but always get phlegm and coughy when I laugh hard or run a shorter distance. I was picked up by an ambulance and brought to the emergency room earlier this week because it was hard to breathe. Basically I was panting because my body told me too and whenever I tried to slow down my breathing it feels like when you’re holding your breath. The ambulance and emergency room found my O2 saturation at 100% and my blood gas showed signs of hyperventilation. Now this doesn't and didn’t surprise me at all as I can feel that I am getting enough oxygen, as long as I am panting. The first time this happened during another infection I had pre-corona the emergency room all thought I was having a panic attack. That is absolutely not what is happening. I have had them in the past, they’re completely different and don’t last for 6-8 hours. EKG was good. Blood gas good. As I managed to slow my breathing down more and more without feeling like I was going to suffocate my saturation sank and eventually the panting stopped completely and I had a saturation at 93-94%. According to the hospital staff, my saturation should still be bad even with the panting if that was the problem. I argue that my body obviously is panting for a reason. It’s basically very laborsome to fill my lungs. Am I missing something here? Is my logic really not valid? And what words am I supposed to use to explain how I feel to avoid the panic attack label? And why would I suddenly feel shortness of breath if I have no trouble saturating? Thank you for reading this far. While I’m just thankful I don’t need medical help, I want to understand what I am going through."

Are they still generally safe given that they’re wearing a highly protective mask? Does repeatedly handling the “contaminated” part of the mask practically negate the purpose of wearing one? What if the person touches the mask with one hand and blows their nose with the other? I’d appreciate some clarity on this. Thank you."

Because if they remain deadly, they kill off their hosts and have no place to replicate and spread. Kind of interesting thought.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095397/  Title of the article:  We shouldn’t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks.  Mutations are an expected part of virology and often, they become less severe as it happens. Would be good news. Seems to be the case for the new covid variant out of South Africa as it is being said to be less severe.  Obviously not getting comfortable or anything, scheduled for my booster next week.

Within a few minutes I had the sensation of pins and needles passing back and forth across my body. At about 15 minutes I was nauseous. By the evening i had diarrhea. The next morning when I woke up my left arm (injection arm) was extremely painful, The pain extended down my arm into my elbow and wrist and my grip strength was diminished. The pain continued to expand out across my body and into my hips, legs, neck, chest, feet, pretty much every where. My skin buzzed and I had internal tremors. I felt like I was plugged into an electrical outlet. My eyes were inflamed and blurry, my ear were ringing very loudly, I became sun sensitive and it felt like my skin was burning and itchy at the same time. I would sweat very much with very little exertion. My legs were shaky and buckled as I walked. I had extreme pain all over my body with sharp pressure points in several areas including my neck, throat, back/ shoulders, low back, elbows, knees, feet etc. I even had seizures for a few nights. (not grand maul but my body would cramp up and start shaking and shivering uncontrollably). My blood pressure which was borderline high skyrocketed to 198/105 and stayed in the 190's/100's for a few weeks. Anxiety was high, depression setting in, memory and thinking were diminished. Did I mention sharp abdominal pain when pressed? These symptoms progressed for a little over three months and then finally started to subside. As a result of my falling and instability I did get a labral tear in my right hip. Throughout this I have been seen by my general practitioner, rheumatologist orthopedist and yes a psychiatrist for the severe anxiety, depression and cognitive issues. I have had a myriad of blood work completed  for inflammatory markers and autoimmune indicators which all returned normal except as follows; ANA - positive ANCA  ANTIBODIES - positive ATYPICAL P-ANCA TITER - elevated above normal range (1:32 titer  standard less than 1:20 titer) AST - higher than normal Chloride - lower than normal So far I get the I don't know, don't worry answer.

Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/I-feel-overly-anxious/show/3068579,I feel overly anxious.,"I (26F) and my daughter had both tested positive for COVID last month. It has been almost six weeks since I tested positive for COVID. It has been three weeks since my daughter tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID with both a home test and a PCR test before I really noticed symptoms. My daughter tested negative at first, and then positive later. I tested negative on a home test a little over three weeks after I first tested positive. My daughter tested negative on a home test a few days after I tested negative on the home test. We both went to the doctor two days ago, and they tested both of us using a PCR COVID test, and we were negative. They also tested her for a lot of other viruses, and they detected rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. We went back yesterday, because my daughter was throwing up. She gets ear infections frequently, so I was worried she had one. They didn't check her ears at the first appointment. They did find that she had an ear infection at the appointment we went to yesterday. They put her on an antibiotic. I am really worried about my child. I am also worried about what I am going through. Even before COVID, I suffered from frequent sinus issues (headaches, pressure, post nasal drip), GERD, pleurisy, muscle and joint pain, etc. I am currently experiencing pain in my legs, fingers, ankles, wrists, arms, and all of my head. I have pressure in my face. I can feel the mucus in my throat. I have a sour taste in my throat. My chest is heavy. It feels like someone has their hand over my mouth and nose. I have pressure and pain in my abdomen and back (I also experienced this before COVID). I am really scared. Do you all think that the tests were accurate? I just hope that we both truly are negative for COVID now."

Anyone else has the same symptoms?,"I contracted COVID two times - October 2020 and in April 2021. Ever since then I’ve been dealing with episodes of hypothermia at unexpected times. My body temperature drops as low as 90° Fahrenheit sometimes and during this time I start to lose consciousness. My body feels lethargic, I have high blood pressure and eventually I start sweating. All this episode takes 10-20 minutes, sometimes even longer. This happens post exertion as well as when I’m resting or taking a nap. Indications of these episodes are sweating, dizziness, body ache, and trepidation. This has affected my lifestyle immensely. I’m only 18 years old. I had these episodes during my final exams as well. I’m also experiencing loss of appetite. Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water. We’ve conducted each and very body test possible, been to numerous doctors and no core problem was ruled out. Basic medication to improve immune system and some antibiotics were prescribed each time and none of it improved my situation. I want to know if anybody else has dealt with a situation like this? What remedies helped them? And if there’s any doctor to help me deal with this specific condition?"

When I got covid in Dec 2021, I had no symptoms except my chest again felt a little tight and the breathing issue became more frequent, every day.

Lack of appetite, odd fatigue & weird sleep patterns, weight loss and muscle wasting, diarrhea, etc. Anyway, I was going on for a month like this and that is how I felt, that some virus was attacking my system. It eventually slowed down to almost nothing today and this past week, and everything is sort of going back to normal (I do have a cough that has been around for a week, and a stuffed up nose, but these too are subsiding). Anyway, I wanted to share this because all tests I took, nothing was able to be found with me.

Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/After-Covid-19-I-Feel-Like-a-Depressed-Brain/show/3074281,"After Covid-19, I Feel Like a Depressed Brain","I work in the Internet industry in the UK. I suffered from depression three years ago. I was basically cured before I was infected with the new crown in November 2021. I have stopped using antidepressants. But after being infected with the new crown, the depression relapsed again. The doctor judged that it was one of the symptoms of the new crown, brain fog, which continued. After getting the new crown, I felt that I was ""brain-dead"", I didn't want to do anything, and I felt extremely anxious. It started with cold-like symptoms, headache, cough, fever, and loss of taste and smell. Chest tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, unresponsiveness, and anxiety also occur. The whole situation is not good. I lost four kilograms in weight. All four members of my family were infected with the new crown, one after another. I couldn’t live a normal life for about a month. Apart from feeling tired all the time, the two children recovered relatively quickly, but daily life such as food and clothing needed to be taken care of, and I felt that life was fragmented and messed up, and I couldn't cope at all. I remember that I had a cough for three weeks, was bedridden for a month, and then took a long sick leave for more than three months. I simply can't afford to get out of bed to cook, the kids eat takeout every day and they have mouth sores for a long time. Fortunately, there are friends who help and often send us home-made delicacies. At that time, volunteers from the community also sent me antidepressants to my home to ensure that I could take them in time. My family doctor advised me to ask a counselor again. The biggest push for me was a few home visits by the social worker in charge of child welfare. The well-intentioned help made me extremely anxious and insomnia. I felt that I was an incompetent mother who couldn't even do the most basic things to take care of my children. Does the new crown make me a useless person! This is unacceptable to me. The regular doctor's consultation and the kind greetings from the leaders of the unit also made me feel like a burden, and I didn't want to be sick all the time. This day-to-day burnout and bedriddenness made me feel worthless. For a long time, I thought I had Alzheimer's. I can't remember anything, and I look for things every day. What the doctor said has to be asked several times over and over again to understand. Sometimes after calling in the morning to confirm, call again in the afternoon and ask again. Later, when I was browsing the web, I noticed in longcovidcarecenter that my symptoms may belong to post covid brain fog, and I checked many papers here to confirm my guess. Sometimes I don't know if I have taken medicine or not. Going into the kitchen, I forgot what I was going to do. Looking at the pills with a glass of water, I asked myself if I just took the medicine or didn’t take it? Because of the confusion caused by many small things, I deeply doubted my ability to handle things. She feels that she must first learn to forgive herself and accept herself who is often tired and forgetful. Family doctors and psychologists believe that the new crown and its chain effects have become an inducement for the recurrence of depression, and the dose of antidepressants needs to be increased. It has been five months since the dose was increased, and the effect is obvious. She is recovering, but she still has symptoms of anxiety and fatigue, and her physical strength has not yet fully recovered. Now I want to start with doing one small thing every day, to be happier and stay optimistic. Doctors hope to gradually taper off the antidepressants over the course of a year."

The place on my arm where i received the shot aches a bit, and i'm feeling a little bit of flu-like feelings, but the symptom i'm concerned about is a build up of snot in my nose, when i blow it out it's very dark, almost black colored, and laced with blood, is this something to be concerned about?"

Is any of them a better or worse, or effective, or safer place to get the new booster than the others?"

Long COVID often arises in otherwise healthy young people, and it can follow even a mild initial infection. A meta-analysis of 41 studies conducted in 2021 concluded that worldwide, 43 percent of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 may develop long COVID, with about 30 percent—translating to approximately 30 million people—affected in the U.S. Some studies have offered more conservative numbers. A June 2022 survey reported by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics found that among adults who had had COVID, one in five was experiencing long COVID three months later; the U.K. Office for National Statistics put the estimate at one in 10. Even if only a small share of infections result in long COVID, experts say, they will add up to millions more people affected—and potentially disabled."

Covid,https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/Have-I-used-up-all-my-vaccine-antibodies/show/3069995,Have I used up all my vaccine antibodies?,"Do we use up our vaccine antibodies each time we are exposed to covid? I ask this because I have recently been exposed to covid on a daily basis whilst caring for an elderly relative. I managed to stay negative for a whole week before eventually testing positive. Then I went down hill rapidly. There is no doubt I was exposed for days, because I had my relative practically coughing in my face for days. It felt as though my vaccine antibodies (last booster 4 months ago) were keeping the virus at bay until all my antibodies were used up and then I just caught it big time. In fact I was really quite ill. Worse than my elderly relative. The WHO has this to say about vaccine lifespan… “Immunity may reduce faster in people who are older or who have underlying medical conditions, or who have a high level of exposure to the virus” It is this last part that I find interesting and is quite important for carers who may be exposed to covid over an extended period."

I've been asymptomatic. I was trying to figure out how I'm going to make ends meet after missing one week of work. It looks like I'm going to have to miss 2 weeks of work now!  Is there not any assistance available when you're forced to not work from covid?
